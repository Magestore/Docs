### One Step Checkout page Overview
If you set enabling **Redirect to checkout automatically after adding product to cart** (see more in *session 3.1*), whenever Customers choose product and click Add to cart, it will be automatically navigated to Checkout page.

Otherwise, Customers have to select the cart icon in the top-right corner and click on **Go to Checkout**. Then, it will redirect to the Checkout page. Here they can see the difference between the Step-by-Step default Checkout page of Magento and One Step Checkout page.

The Step-by-Step checkout page is a page with 5 separate steps including **Billing Address, Shipping Address, Shipping Method, Payment Method** and **Order Review**. Customers have to complete each step before going to the next one. On the One Step Checkout page, all steps appear simultaneously. **Customers can fill in/edit information of any steps any time.** This improvement can save Customers 2-3 minutes for checkout.
