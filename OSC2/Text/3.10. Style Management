### Style Management
This feature allows you to customize style for the Checkout page of each store view.
You can change color of headings and the **Place Order Now** button to fit your store’s theme. There are 8 colors for you to select, including orange, green, black, blue, dark blue, pink, red and violet. If none of the default colors match your desire, you can select the Custom option and then customize your preferred one using the color picker table. With each store, you can select the color you want or use the default color.
After selecting a color, you will see a preview of your checkout page with the color chosen.
