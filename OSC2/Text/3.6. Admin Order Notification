### Admin Order Notification
An important feature of One Step Checkout is to send email notifications to Admin when new orders are placed. Moreover, you can enter a list of emails which you want to receive email notification.
To customize email template, go to **Maketing Email Templates**, select **Add New Template**, then choose the **New Order Notification** template and click on the **Load Template** button.
