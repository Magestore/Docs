## Billing Address, Shipping Address
If Customers have already logged in, they can skip the **Shipping Address** section as their information is automatically added. If Customers want to change shipping address, select **New Address** and change the information.

In case of not logging in, they will see fields to fill in: First name, Last name, Address...as you configured in backend.
After providing a shipping address, if Customers want to create bill to another address, they can unselect the box **My billing and shipping address are the same** then fill information in the **Billing Address** section.

In both **Billing Address** and **Shipping Address** sections, when Customers type some first characters of their address, the system will show matching results suggested by Google.

Customers just need to select a correct option and then, other fields such as **City, Country, Zip Code, State/Province** will be automatically filled out.

When there is any change in **Shipping Address** and **Billing Address** sections, **Shipping Method, Payment Method** and **Order Review** will be updated right away without reloading the page. Why is this feature useful? Let us give an example. A Customer may consider between 2 shipping addresses. He can see right on the checkout page that for 1 address, shipping fee is cheaper and payment method can be Cash On Delivery, but with the other address, just money transfer and advanced payment are accepted.
