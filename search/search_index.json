After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as above.\n\n\nIn this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the \nCancel\n link will be disabled.

There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, range of values and drop-down values.    \u2022    Fixed Value : These credit products have fixed value.    \u2022    Drop-down Values : With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.   \u2022    Range of Values : With this type, customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend.    After selecting credit products they like, customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.  When the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the customer\u2019s credit balance.   Customers can also send Credits to their friends  1)  Tick  Send credit to friend  checkbox   2)  Enter the name of the recipient   3)  Enter the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address  4)  Enter the message that recipient will receive.  Option 2:  In this second way, they will be navigated to the  My Credit  page on which they just need to click on the  Buy store credit  button. See section  Send Credit to Friends  to see how it works for customers.   When the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address.    \u2022    Case 1 : if the recipient do not have an account in the system, an email as above will be sent.  \u2022    Case 2 : if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.

After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.   As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.   At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the  Credit Code List  section as above.  In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the  Cancel  link in the  Action  column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.  Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the  Cancel  link will be disabled. Please refer to the section    Redeem Credit  for more information.

Customers can check their current balances and transactions in the  Transaction History  section.   At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction.  ii.   Case 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.

To verify, customers can:  1)   Enter the verification code they received in their emails   2)  Click on the  Submit Code  button.

The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the extension in back-end.\n\n\nNew release:\n One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1:\n Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials\n Tab. \n\n\nClick this tab and after that, a box will appear with \nAPI key\n on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose \nBrowser key\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Get the key and paste it in your page \n\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n After all, in \nLibrary\n tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nHoliday Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Holidays >\n click on \nAdd Holiday\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nHoliday Name, Store, Starting Date, End Date\n and \nComment\n - which is shown as notification to customers\n\n\n(2) Remember to click \nSave Item\n if you\u2019ve done or \nSave and Continue Edit\n to avoid losing what you\u2019ve written. \n\n\nOR ELSE, you can click on \nReset\n to delete all you\u2019ve created or \nBack\n to delete all and come back to the Manage Holiday Page.\n\n\nSpecial Day Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Special Days >\n click on \nAdd Special Day\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nSpecial Day Name\n and select \nStore, Starting Date, End Date\n\n\n(2) \nTimer Interval:\n Set Time Interval between 2 shipping times\n\n\n(3) \nOpening Time\n and \nClosing Time:\n choose working time for special day\n\n\n(4) \nComment:\n enter comment which will be shown as notification to your customers. \n\n\nRemember to click \nSave\n to finish\n\n\nTag Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Tags >\n click on \nAdd Tag\n\n\n\n\n(1) \nName:\n Enter the name\n\n\n(2) \nTag Icon: Choose File\n to upload Icon\n\n\n(3) \nStatus:\n choose \nEnabled\n to activate the tag\n\n\nShipment Method\n\n\nPath: \nSystem > Configuration > Sales > Shipping Methods > Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n(1) You can edit these fields as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n choose \nYes\n to activate Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier title:\n enter the carrier title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod title:\n enter the method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice:\n enter the price of this method/service (Once you edit, the price will be default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) \nCustome Methods:\n\n\nYou can have another option for Web POS Shipping by creating as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Title: \n enter the name of method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Price: \n enter the price of the Custom Method.

If you don\u2019t receive the email, you can directly login to your account dashboard at MageStore then go to  My Account/My License Certificates . Here you will select your  Order number  and a corresponding  Product  then type the  back-end domain of your live site . It is optional to add your Development Domains right or later. Click on the  Generate Certificate  button to get your  License Certificate.   Note:   License Certificate  is a PDF document that contains your License Information including your Product Name, License Serial, License Type, Registered Domain, Expiration date, etc. Your  License Serial  is unique and can only be used once for one module. You can go to MageStore  Check License Information  page, enter your License Serial to check your license status. You can also view your License Information in back-end when your module installation is finished.    Go to  My Downloadable Products . Choose the version of the module then download it. The file that you download is normally a zip file.    It\u2019s required to enable cache in the administration panel of your site. Go to  System/Cache Management . Choose all caches and click on  Enable  then submit.    Use FTP client (such as Filezilla, WinSCP, cuteFtp) to upload or copy all folders in the zip package to your Magento site root folder.

Go to  System/Cache Management . Select all caches and take action  Refresh  then submit.    Navigate to  System/Configuration . If you can see the module tab, it is installed properly.    Now if you get access denied error when click on the module tab, you need to log out admin panel and log in again.    Go to front-end and try to process, make sure that everything is OK.    Note:  In the case that you have followed all above steps but couldn\u2019t make the module work properly, to make your website function as normal, you can delete the file or change the module\u2019s filename module in  app/etc/magestore_module_name.xml  (for example, change  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml  to  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml.bka  ).

New release:  One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.  This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1:  Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu.    Step 2:  Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3:  On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials  Tab.   Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with  API key  on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.   After that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose  Browser key     Step 4:  Fill in your name and domain and then click create   Step 5:  Get the key and paste it in your page    Step 6:  After all, in  Library  tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below",

Those actions happen in turn, again and again, so your store will have cash in as well as cash out. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: \nThis function is available now in Magento 2 and will be updated soon for  Magento 1. \n\n\nPOS Order\n\n\nLike the flow we explain above, this section is also instructed according to the timing circle. Particularly, it is the customer buying process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Customers select products to buy and bring them to Cashier\n   to pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Cashier could add them to carts.\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, one thing to remind retailers is that having a customer card system is extremely necessary for sales strategy. So, it exists a demand from POS System: make sure all of the shoppers, even when they are not regular consumers, have member cards at your store. \n\n\n\n\nIf this buyer were a brand new customer, Cashier would create a new one.  Here is the detailed instruction:\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n \n\n\nTap the human icon > \u201cCreate Customer\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Cashier could search and create order based on customer history data. All the staffs need to do is typing the customer information (such as: phone number, email, address,..)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding products to carts, Cashiers would push sales by applying Promotion and Loyalty Program \u2013 which are available functions when retailers install specialized extensions for their own POS System. For instance, they are Coupon Code, Gift Card, Reward Point and Store Credit.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step, Cashier must select shipping method:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers would receive goods at store if they buy in-store. \n\n\nThe other option is shipping to customer\u2019s address. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Cashiers have to choose shipping and payment method\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, if customers require invoice, Cashiers will take the output of Customer Invoice. \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, Cashier need to validate this POS order to make sure this\n   transaction is available.\n\n\n\n\nIf this transaction is confirmed as a good delivery, then it will be accomplished in the next few seconds. \n\n\nOtherwise, Cashier may cancel this order, back to the previous step to serve another customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as customers open their wallets to pay for orders, cash flow\n   will be created (Cashier will receive money and put the change back).\n   It appears the cash-in and out.\n   Obviously, all of these cash flows are recorded in the system. \n\n\nIf Cashiers put money in Cash Drawer, Cash-in will be saved with reason.\n\n\nIf Cashiers take money out Cash Drawer, Cash-out will be also saved with reason. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the end of \u201cPOS Order\u201d workflow. \n\n\nPOS Return Order\n\n\nIn case Consumers want to return products, here is the process your staffs need following to deal with the change in data system. \n\n\nFrom the history data of POS Order, Cashiers are able to \ncheck the return rule.\n \nIf this Return Order is valid, all those steps below need accomplishing: \n\n\n\n\nCashier will create Return Order \n\n\nThen, Good Receipt is allowed and the system is available to receive product\n\n\nAfter that, Customer will be refunded\n\n\n\n\nHere is step-by-step instruction: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1\n: Check Refund Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the history data of POS Order, Cashiers/Sales Staffs are able to check the return rule. If the order meets the refund condition, then POS staffs go to the next process of refunding. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: Some certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash/credits (which is set by admin in the backend). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Implement Refund Process \n\n\n\n\nTo issue refund, go to Orders tab in POS screen, choose Orders History, select the order that is required to refund.  Tap on Refund button at the end of the popup.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nA popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund.  Tick \u201cReturn to stock\u201d if you want to return those items back to your stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  Name of the refund product\n\n\n[2]  Adjust Refund:\n\n\n[3] Adjust Fee:\n\n\n[4] Refund by Credits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of refund by cash, you can refund for customer a certain amount of credits to keep them around your store and purchase next time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit \u201c\nSubmit Refund\n\u201d. After that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully.  Please make sure you have permission to issue refund.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n: Exchange the product in the order\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the customer want to exchange the product, create a refund like the same steps above at Make Order(s).  Then create the same order, with the exchange product. After that,  proceed with the order and check out.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd the exchange product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information Notice\n \n\n\nCopyright 2017. All Rights Reserved.

the amount of cash in your store at that time. \n\n\nThose numbers will be saved in the system, so POS could provide you information about daily revenue after a working day. \n\n\nParticularly, when you log in to any POS, a window of opening session will pop-up automatically. \n\n\n\n\n(1) Name of the staff in this session \n\n\n(2) Location of POS \n\n\n(3) Opening Balance before starting new session\n\n\n(4) Value of the currency contrbuting to Opening Balance (such as: $100 ) \n\n\n(5) Number of the currency unit (for example : 2) \n\n\n(6) Subtotal (you will have: $100 * 2 = $200) \n\n\n(7) After checking all the information above, click this button to Open New Session\n\n\nType the \ncoin/bill value\n > Put in \nthe number\n of those\n   coins/bills  > Click \u201c\nOpen Session\n\u201d\n\n\nIn case you logged in to POS but no window pop-up automatically like the picture above, then you need to make some change in the back-end system. \nHere is the instruction: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \u201c\nStore\n\u201d > \u201c\nConfiguration\n\u201d > Select \u201c\nMagestore Extension\n\u201d > \nWebPOS\n\nSelect \u201c\nYes\n\u201d on this  red frame and please don\u2019t forget to click \u201c\nSave Config\n\u201d to make it work \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step, after the Opening Balance was saved by POS Manager, Cashiers now are able to create orders and they start running cash flow in your store. \n\n\nThey receive the payment from customers and then put the change back to them. Those actions happen in turn, again and again, so your store will have cash in as well as cash out. \n\n\nOn the screen of POS System, it will be displayed like this\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, at the end of the day, POS Managers must undertake mission to create Closing Balance, which means they have to confirm the amount of cash in store after all transactions on that day. Then, the system would be able to provide Session Report for Manager. It reflects two things: Cash and Payment Slip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now, it\u2019s time for Managers checked Closing Balance. 2 situations could happen in this step: \n\n\n\n\nIf the Theory and Real Balance are the same, Managers could directly move to the step of Set Closing Balance, then end this workflow (Session Management) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Theory and Real Balance are not the same, Managers have 2 options below to solve this problem; \n            If accept the difference, Manager has to accept the Profit or Loss (with reason) \n            \n    Otherwise, Staffs have to Put the money in or Take Money out (with reason)\n\n    ![General Sales Process](./img/R11.png?raw=true)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) Amount of cash that staff will put in\n\n\n(2) Reason\n\n\n(3) Name of Staff will do this action**\n\n\n\n\n(1) Amount of cash that staff will take out\n\n\n(2) Reason\n\n\n(3) Name of Staff will do this action\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter all, when the Theory Balance\u2019s equal to the Real one, POS Managers are able to \u201cSet Closing Balance\u201d.

Particularly, it is the customer buying process. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitially, Customers select products to buy and bring them to Cashier\n   to pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Cashier could add them to carts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, one thing to remind retailers is that having a customer card system is extremely necessary for sales strategy. So, it exists a demand from POS System: make sure all of the shoppers, even when they are not regular consumers, have member cards at your store. \n\n\n\n\nIf this buyer were a brand new customer, Cashier would create a new one.  Here is the detailed instruction:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTap the human icon > \u201cCreate Customer\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Cashier could search and create order based on customer history data. All the staffs need to do is typing the customer information (such as: phone number, email, address,..)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding products to carts, Cashiers would push sales by applying Promotion and Loyalty Program \u2013 which are available functions when retailers install specialized extensions for their own POS System. For instance, they are Coupon Code, Gift Card, Reward Point and Store Credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext step, Cashier must select shipping method:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers would receive goods at store if they buy in-store. \n\n\nThe other option is shipping to customer\u2019s address. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, Cashiers have to choose payment method\n\n\n\n\nIn this step, if customers require invoice, Cashiers will take the output of Customer Invoice. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, Cashier need to validate this POS order to make sure this\n   transaction is available.\n\n\n\n\nIf this transaction is confirmed as a good delivery, then it will be accomplished in the next few seconds. \n\n\nOtherwise, Cashier may cancel this order, back to the previous step to serve another customer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, as customers open their wallets to pay for orders, cash flow\n   will be created (Cashier will receive money and put the change back).\n   It appears the cash-in and out.\n   Obviously, all of these cash flows are recorded in the system. \n\n\nIf Cashiers put money in Cash Drawer, Cash-in will be saved with reason.\n\n\nIf Cashiers take money out Cash Drawer, Cash-out will be also saved with reason. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the end of \u201cPOS Order\u201d workflow. \n\n\nPOS Return Order\n\n\nIn case Consumers want to return products, here is the process your staffs need following to deal with the change in data system. \n\n\nFrom the history data of POS Order, Cashiers are able to \ncheck the return rule.\n \nIf this Return Order is valid, all those steps below need accomplishing: \n\n\n\n\nCashier will create Return Order \n\n\nThen, Good Receipt is allowed and the system is available to receive product\n\n\nAfter that, Customer will be refunded\n\n\n\n\nHere is step-by-step instruction: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1\n: Check Refund Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the history data of POS Order, Cashiers/Sales Staffs are able to check the return rule.

Tap on Refund button at the end of the popup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund.  Tick \u201cReturn to stock\u201d if you want to return those items back to your stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]  Name of the refund product\n[2]  Adjust Refund:\n[3] Adjust Fee:\n[4] Refund by Credits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of refund by cash, you can refund for customer a certain amount of credits to keep them around your store and purchase next time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHit \u201c\nSubmit Refund\n\u201d. After that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully.

Initially, Customers select products to buy and bring them to Cashier\n   to pay.    Then, Cashier could add them to carts.      Anyway, one thing to remind retailers is that having a customer card system is extremely necessary for sales strategy. So, it exists a demand from POS System: make sure all of the shoppers, even when they are not regular consumers, have member cards at your store.    If this buyer were a brand new customer, Cashier would create a new one.  Here is the detailed instruction:     Tap the human icon > \u201cCreate Customer\u201d    Otherwise, Cashier could search and create order based on customer history data. All the staffs need to do is typing the customer information (such as: phone number, email, address,..)    After adding products to carts, Cashiers would push sales by applying Promotion and Loyalty Program \u2013 which are available functions when retailers install specialized extensions for their own POS System. For instance, they are Coupon Code, Gift Card, Reward Point and Store Credit.       Next step, Cashier must select shipping method:   Customers would receive goods at store if they buy in-store.   The other option is shipping to customer\u2019s address.      Then, Cashiers have to choose payment method   In this step, if customers require invoice, Cashiers will take the output of Customer Invoice.         After that, Cashier need to validate this POS order to make sure this\n   transaction is available.   If this transaction is confirmed as a good delivery, then it will be accomplished in the next few seconds.   Otherwise, Cashier may cancel this order, back to the previous step to serve another customer.    Finally, as customers open their wallets to pay for orders, cash flow\n   will be created (Cashier will receive money and put the change back).\n   It appears the cash-in and out.\n   Obviously, all of these cash flows are recorded in the system.   If Cashiers put money in Cash Drawer, Cash-in will be saved with reason.  If Cashiers take money out Cash Drawer, Cash-out will be also saved with reason.       It is the end of \u201cPOS Order\u201d workflow.",

From the history data of POS Order, Cashiers are able to  check the return rule.  \nIf this Return Order is valid, all those steps below need accomplishing:    Cashier will create Return Order   Then, Good Receipt is allowed and the system is available to receive product  After that, Customer will be refunded   Here is step-by-step instruction:     Step 1 : Check Refund Policy    From the history data of POS Order, Cashiers/Sales Staffs are able to check the return rule. If the order meets the refund condition, then POS staffs go to the next process of refunding.     NOTE: Some certain staffs have permission to issue refund by cash/credits (which is set by admin in the backend).       Step 2 : Implement Refund Process    To issue refund, go to Orders tab in POS screen, choose Orders History, select the order that is required to refund.  Tap on Refund button at the end of the popup.     A popup will display so that you can fill in the information before making refund.  Tick \u201cReturn to stock\u201d if you want to return those items back to your stock.    [1]  Name of the refund product\n[2]  Adjust Refund:\n[3] Adjust Fee:\n[4] Refund by Credits.

After that, you will get the message informing that credit memo is created successfully.  Please make sure you have permission to issue refund.      Step 3 : Exchange the product in the order    If the customer want to exchange the product, create a refund like the same steps above at Make Order(s).  Then create the same order, with the exchange product. After that,  proceed with the order and check out.      End the exchange product.       Confidential Information Notice    Copyright 2017.

            "text": "BARCODE MANAGEMENT - USER GUIDE FOR MAGENTO 1\n\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nBarcode by definition is the small image of lines (bars) and spaces that is affixed to retail store items, identification cards, and postal mail to identify a particular product number, person, or location. The code uses a sequence of vertical bars and spaces to represent numbers and other symbols. Barcode is a reliable method for cutting costs and savingtime for business.\n\n\nBarcode management module from Magestore provides your business with a handful solution to generate barcode, print barcode label and scan barcode, all in one.\n\n\nMagento Barcode Management\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\n\nBarcode listing\n\n\nBarcode listing is a view to display all barcodes of all products saved in Inventory Management. It contains Barcode, SKU, Supplier and Purchased Time.\n\n\nFrom this screen, admin can instantly take actions like importing or generating barcode with 5 buttons on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nAdmin can also view details of each product and barcode. \n\n\n\n\nFrom barcode detailed page, admin can configure barcode printing and print barcode directly. Product information is shown including Image, name, price and its availability in each warehouse.\n\n\nGenerate barcode\n\n\nInventory Management gives you 2 modes to generate barcode:\n\n\n\n\nOne barcode per product SKU\n\n\nMultiple barcodes per product SKU\nThis can be configured in Barcode Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d, then the system will allow you to generate only one barcode for one product SKU.\nNow to generate barcode, you go to Generate Barcodes tab. From here you can select the product that you want to generate barcode, fill in the Supplier (optional) then generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cNo\u201d, then it opens up 2 options to generate barcode when you go to Generate Barcodes tab.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Barcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2 options are: Generate barcode per item or Generate barcode per purchase.\n\u201cGenerate barcode per item\u201d means each item will have its own identified barcode although they have the same SKU.\n\n\n\u201cGenerate barcode per purchase\u201d means items will be identified by the time it is purchased. Although you take 10 items with same SKU in one time purchasing from supplier, these 10 items will have the same barcode. But in another time of purchase, they will have different barcode.\n\n\nAfter selecting the option you want to proceed with, you can continue selecting product, fill the product Qty., supplier and purchased time (optional) then generate. \n\n\nAdmin can configure the barcode pattern to generate. Barcodes generated will be saved in Barcode listing page & Barcode creating history.\n\n\n\n\nImport barcode\n\n\nWhen you generate barcodes in mass, you will not need to use Generate barcode feature. Instead, you can import barcode directly into the system using the \nImport barcode\n feature of Inventory Management.\n\n\nThe system provides a sample import file including SKU, Barcode, Qty. and Supplier & Purchase time (optional).\n\n\n\n\nAfter preparing the file as in the sample file, now you can upload the file, fill the reason and start to import.\n\n\nBarcode label template\n\n\nYou can create your own barcode template by adding new template.

When you finish, remember to click on \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n to save your work.\n\n\n\n\nAfter installing Magestore Gift Card successfully, you will find Amazon Gift Card template in Magento backend. To use other templates including Top, Left, Right and Simple template, you need to configure a little bit.\n\n\n\n\nIn Settings, you choose No in field \u201cShow only Amazon style template\u201d then you will have all 5 templates displayed in backend.\n\n\n\n\nCreate/Edit a Gift Card Products\n\n\nThere are two ways to create a Gift Card product: on \nManage Gift Card Products\n page and on \nManage Products\n page.\n\n\n\n\nCreate Gift Card on \nManage Gift Card Products\n page:\n\n\n\n\nGo to Gift Card menu\u2192 \nManage Gift Card Products\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nAdd Gift Card Product\n button\n\n\n\n\nClick on Continue button then enter information as a normal product. You should pay attention to the following tabs:\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from normal products, there is another required field, \nSelect Gift Card template\n, allowing you to choose templates for Gift Card product. You can add more templates to this field in \nManage Gift Card Templates\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrices\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nIn \nPrices\n tab, Admin can configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product.\n\n\n\nThe module provides 3 \ntypes of Gift Card value\n, including \nfixed value, range of values and dropdown values\n. You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the \nrange of values\n type.\n\n\nThe next step you need to do is selecting the type of Gift Card price, which could be 1 in 3 following options:\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n: Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.\n\n\nFixed number\n: Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field.\n\n\nPercent of Gift Card value\n: Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value as you configure in the next field.\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose the type of Gift Card price as \nFixed number\n or \nPercent of Gift Card value\n, remember to fill in the next field \nPrice/ Percentage\n to set the price for your Gift Card product.\n\n\nThe following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.\n\n\n\n\nType of Gift Card value\n: Dropdown values\n\n\nGift Card values\n: 20,30,40\n\n\nType of Gift Card price\n: Percent of Gift Card value\n\n\nPercentage\n: 90,90,90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nConditions\n tabs:\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are \nShopping Cart Conditions\n and \nCart Item Conditions\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nShopping Cart Conditions\n tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nCart Item Conditions\n tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers\u2019 shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don\u2019t see the attribute you want when setting \nGift Card\u2019s Conditions\n, such as SKU, you can go to Catalog\u2192 Attributes\u2192 Manage Attributes. Search and choose Attribute Code, such as \"SKU\". Then change \"Use for Promo Rule Conditions\" to \"Yes\"\n\n\nRemember to click on \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n button to save your work. After saving, the Gift Card product which you have just created will be shown on \nManage Gift Products\n page as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Gift Card on \nManage Products\n page:\n\n\nGo to Catalog menu \u2192 \nManage Products\n   \n\n\nClick on \nAdd Product\n button\n\n\nSelect \nProduct Type: Gift Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \nContinue\n button and enter information as in \nManage Gift Card Product\n page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter saving, Gift Card product which you have just created is shown on both \nManage Products\n page and \nManage Gift Products\n page as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to edit any Gift product, you need to click on corresponding row or link \nEdit\n.

If you choose the type of Gift Card price as  Fixed number  or  Percent of Gift Card value , remember to fill in the next field  Price/ Percentage  to set the price for your Gift Card product.  The following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.   Type of Gift Card value : Dropdown values  Gift Card values : 20,30,40  Type of Gift Card price : Percent of Gift Card value  Percentage : 90,90,90     So Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.     Conditions  tabs:   The difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are  Shopping Cart Conditions  and  Cart Item Conditions .   The  Shopping Cart Conditions  tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.     The  Cart Item Conditions  tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers\u2019 shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.\n       Note : Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don\u2019t see the attribute you want when setting  Gift Card\u2019s Conditions , such as SKU, you can go to Catalog\u2192 Attributes\u2192 Manage Attributes. Search and choose Attribute Code, such as \"SKU\". Then change \"Use for Promo Rule Conditions\" to \"Yes\"  Remember to click on  Save  or  Save and Continue Edit  button to save your work. After saving, the Gift Card product which you have just created will be shown on  Manage Gift Products  page as below:    Create Gift Card on  Manage Products  page:  Go to Catalog menu \u2192  Manage Products      Click on  Add Product  button  Select  Product Type: Gift Card      Click on  Continue  button and enter information as in  Manage Gift Card Product  page.

And how to keep track of each item's quantity change? Magestore's Instock Management module is here to help. With this inventory management module, you are able to:\n\n\n\n\nSave time in stock control by in-line mass adjustment;\n\n\nReduce cost by low stock notifications and supply need forecast in time;\n\n\nAvoid stock loss with convenient 5-step stock taking process.\n\n\n\n\nMagento \nInventory Management\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\nTerminologies and principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminology\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity in warehouse(s)\n\n\nThe real quantity of a product in the physical warehouse. It equals the sum of Available Qty and Qty to Ship\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable Quantity\n\n\nThe quantity of each product which shows up in Virtual Catalog (front store). It\u2019s also the quantity remaining that are available to be sold\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantity to ship\n\n\nThe number of items has been ordered but not been shipped yet. This number will be returned to Avail Qty & Qty in Warehouse(s) if the shipment is cancelled\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShelf Location\n\n\nInsert the detailed area in the shelf where the product is located. This is how you can support your staff in finding the product efficiently in the physical warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse\n\n\nA \u201cwarehouse\u201d in Inventory Management represents for a physical place where you keep your stock. Stocks can be moved between warehouses, purchased for a Warehouse and shipped from a Warehouse. Employees (with different admin accounts) can be restricted to handling only warehouse(s) with which they work\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Warehouse\n\n\nPrimary Warehouse is automatically created after the module is installed which contains all products in your catalog. This warehouse cannot be deleted to make sure that there is always at least one warehouse consisting of your inventory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarehouse Pemission\n\n\nAssign and manage a staff account permission level in controlling a specific warehouse. Base on Roles Assigned, an user who has full authorities will have permission to create new role & set up new user with specific permissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Adjustment\n\n\nAdjust Stock action is used to correct/ update inventory levels of your products and records them in Stock Adjustment History. This will change the product's Qty. in the Stock in Warehouse grid. After that, the system will update Available Qty. accordingly (or the quantity in default Catalog Products) after subtracting Qty allocated in sales orders from the new Qty in Warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Adjustment History\n\n\nStock Adjustment History records all inventory corrections/ updates when there are some differences between stock levels of physical and virtual warehouses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocktaking\n\n\nStocktaking is performed to double-check and prevent any mismatch between the recorded product quantities and the actual inventory in your physical warehouses. The process includes 5 stages containing stock counting and admin\u2019s approval before actually updating the Qty in the system\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStocktaking History\n\n\nStocktaking History records all stocktaking acts and their process status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Movement History\n\n\nStock Movements are records of inward &outward stock transfers of your primary warehouse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Needs\n\n\nSupply Need is the system\u2019s prediction about how many inventory items you need for each product within a future period.

With Magento Store Credit module, you can enhance the interaction with your Customers by many activities such as adding credit or refunding Customers by credit. After that, Customers can use the credit to make purchases on your store or even share with their friends. Also with our Magento Store Credit module, credit can be used as a convenient and time-saving payment method when it just requires your Customers to recharge their credit accounts one time and then use for many future purchases.\n\n\nMagento \nStore Credit\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n\nBuy Credit Product\n\n\nAfter Customers login to your website, they can access the \nStore Credit\n page in two ways.\n\n\nFirstly, clicking on the \nMy Account\n link, they can choose \nBuy Store Credit\n in the dropdown list. \n\n\n\nSecondly, they can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation on the \nMy Account\n page.\n\n\nIn this second way, they will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the \nStore Credit\n page will be shown as follows:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs you can see, this page lists all credit products of your website. There are three types of credit products for Customers to choose:\n\n\n\n\nFixed Value\n: These credit products have fixed value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Value:\n With this type, Customers can select a value option in the drop-down list box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Value\n: With this type, Customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, Customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Customer\u2019s credit balance.\n\n \n\n\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by ticking \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient\n\n\nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The\n   system will send an email to this address.\n\n\nCustom message\n: the message that recipient will receive\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, if the recipient do not have an account in the system will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient has an account in the system, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\n\n\nThe sender always gets email notifications as below:\n\n\n\n\nManage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nIn order to access the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\nManage Credit Balance\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\n\n\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows Customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n and \ncredit balance.\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n\n\nFirst, Customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page.\n\n\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit To Friends\n and \nCredit Code List\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nSend Credit to Friends\n: In this section, Customers can send credit to their friends.\n\n\n\u2022   \nCredit Code List\n: This section shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed in full for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\nCase 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIn order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the \nSend\n button. \nAfter that, his credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below:\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. When a recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the Cancel link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \nRedeem Credit\n for more information.\n\n\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction:\n\n\n\n\nCase 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIf you configure that Customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the \nSend\n button, they will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, they will be navigated to the \nVerify\n page:\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the \nCredit Code List\n, that code is put under the \u201c\nAwaiting verification\n\u201d status with a \nVerify\n link. \n\n\nTo verify, Customers just enter the verification code they received in their emails and then click on the \nSubmit Code\n button.\n\n\nAfter Customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.\n\n\nRedeem Credit\n\n\nIn order to go to the \nRedeem Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nRedeem Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance by entering the code in the text field before clicking on the \nRedeem\n button. Another way is just to click on the link in the email.\n\n\nAfter redeeming code, Customers can check their current balance and transaction in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout by Credit\n\n\n \n\n\nCustomers can use credit to checkout on both \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nShopping Cart\n page, our module will add a \nCustomer Credit\n block for Customers to use their credit balances to checkout.\n\n\nTo use a credit amount, Customers can first enter that number in the field and then click on the \nApply\n button. Our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of order.\n\n\nPlease note that Customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the \nCustomer Credit\n block as below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout page\n, in the \nPayment Information\n tab, Customers can also use credit to check out by ticking on the checkbox and then enter a credit amount they want.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Customers click on the \nContinue\n button, our module will auto-update the Grand Total of the order.\n\n\nAfter order has been placed, Customers\u2019 credit balances will be updated immediately. They can check the current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\nManage Customers Using Credit\n\n\nGo to \nStore Credit > Manage Customers Using Credit\n\n\n\n\nThen the \nCustomers Using Credit Manager\n page will be displayed as below:\n\n\n\n\nThis page shows a list of all Customers using credit and their information such as name, email, credit balance, telephone, etc.\nIn order to view more details about a Customer, you can click on the \nEdit\n link in the \nAction\n column.\n\n\nThen you will be navigated to the \nStore Credit\n tab on the \nCustomer Manage\n page that shows you all of that Customer\u2019s transaction history and credit balance:\n\n\n\n\nBesides, you can change the Customer\u2019s credit balance by entering an integer (a positive or negative number) and a comment in text fields as below:\n\n \n\n\n\n\nOur module will auto send email to Customer to announce about this transaction if you tick on \nSend email to customer\n checkbox.

Credit codes are not displayed in full for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.  Please note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.  Case 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.  In order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.   If the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:    In this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the  Send  button. \nAfter that, his credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address:   As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.  At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the  Credit Code List  section as below:   In this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. When a recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the  Cancel  link in the  Action  column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.  Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the Cancel link will be disabled. Please refer to the section  Redeem Credit  for more information.  Customers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the  Transaction History  section.    If the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website:    If the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the  Transaction History  section.   At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction:   Case 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.  If you configure that Customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the  Send  button, they will receive an email as below:   At the same time, they will be navigated to the  Verify  page:   On this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the  Credit Code List , that code is put under the \u201c Awaiting verification \u201d status with a  Verify  link.

Thus, 72% of retailers start allowing Customers to purchase online before coming to a store and receive purchased products. If there is a chain of stores available, undoubtedly Customers will choose the nearest one as well as an appropriate time to arrive. How can the store-owner make that happen? The answer is Magento Store Pickup module \u2013 the most professional Magento shipping module, which allows setting up multiple Magento stores, showing addresses and opening time of each store for the Customers\u2019 convenience.\n\n\nMagento \nStore Pickup\n is one module in our \nOmnichannel solution\n for Magento retailers.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n\n\n\nMany times customers want to visit your physical store to pick up products ordered so they can test the quality as well as save the shipping fee. Below, let us introduce you how customers exploit all the usefulness when your store is integrated with the \nStore Pickup\n module.\n\n\nView Store Information\n\n\n \n\n\nStore Pickup module creates a separated page to list all of your stores in the front-end. Customers can access this page by clicking on \nOur Stores\n on Top-Link (the top right of the page) or Footer-Link (the bottom of the page).\n\n\n \nTop-Link\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFooter-Link\n\n\nThe Store Listing page includes 4 sections: \nStore list, Search form, Google Map\n and \nTags list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe list of all stores is shown on the bottom of Google Map. Customers can view store names and base images on this list. \nClick on the icon \n   on the bottom right corner on the G-Map to show store list or click on the \n  to hide store list\n\n\nStore locations are displayed on Google Map. Customers can zoom in/ zoom out and choose view mode as map/ satellite as preferred. Customers can also view store address or get direction by clicking on the pin icon of any store.\n\n\nClick on the icon \n  to search stores by location. Customers need to enter the key word and select criteria. Results that are matched are shown on G-Map. \nClick on the icon \n  to search stores by radius. After customers enter the the location then choose radius, related results are shown on G-Map.\n\n\nBesides, customers can also filter by tags. Customers just have to click on tags they want to search. Then, list of stores which admin add these tags to will be shown.\n\n\n\n\nWhen customers click on a store on the map, they can instantly view the store location along with its name, address, phone number and store manager\u2019s email address. Customers can also get direction on this box.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details of a store, customers can click on its \nView more info\n link to be navigated to the detailed page.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page shows all details that customers want to know about a store before arriving, such as location, contact info, working time, description and store images. \n\n\nThey can also view list of special days & holidays in \nSpecial day & Holiday information\n tab.\nConveniently, they can email store manager by filling in the contact form then clicking on \nSubmit\n.\n\n\nUse Store Pickup at Checkout\n\n\nThe main function of Store Pickup module is allowing customers to select a preferred store at checkout to arrive and pick up their ordered products. This section will show you how the extension works for customers. \n\n\n\n\nIn the \nShipping method\n tab at checkout, customers can select \nStore Pickup\n as their shipping option. Then customers can select a store from the dropdown list: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOr customers can select on Google map as bellow:\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOn the G-Map popup, customer needs to select a store on store list or search store that they want, after that click on the \nApply\n button to apply or click on \nClose\n button to cancel.\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting a store, customers need to choose a specific shipping date and time for arrival, and then check out as usual by clicking on the \nContinue\n button.\n\n\n\n\nIf the shipping date is one of store\u2019s holidays, customers will get a message notifying them to choose another date. Thus, they can avoid arriving on the store\u2019s days off. You can refer to section \n\"Manage Holidays\"\n to know how to set up these holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nPayment Information\n tab, applicable payment methods for \nIn-store Pickup\n are shown as your configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore placing order, customers can also review the store address, shipping date and time along with other order information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Orders\n\n\nTo view their orders with store pickup information, customers can go to \nMy Account\n on Top-Link > \nMy Orders\n tab > \nView Order\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo print orders, customers can click on \nPrint Order\n on the top right.\n\n\nReceive Order Emails\n\n\nAfter placing orders, customers will receive the confirmation email with information about the pickup store.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\nYou have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.\n\n\nNew release:\n* One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that \nrequired future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.**\n\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/maps/faq#using-google-maps-apis\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\n\n\nIn order to get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1\n: Visit APIs Console at \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click \nCreate project\n button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n: On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials T\nab. Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with \"\nAPI key\n\" on it. It is where you should click in order to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with a number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose \nBrowser key\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n: Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Get the key and paste it in your page \n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n: Last but not least, in \nLibrary\n tab, let\u2019s enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nManage Stores\n\n\nIn the back-end, go to \nStore Pickup\n \u2192 \nManage stores.\n The \nStore Manager\n grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status. To add new stores, you can add them manually and import from CSV files.\n\n\n\n\nAdd Store\n\n\nClick on the \nAdd Store\n button on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page. You will be navigated to the \nAdd Store\n page, which includes 3 tabs: \nGeneral Information\n, \nTime Schedule\n and \nCustomer Messages\n.\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n tab: \nThis tab has 3 sessions: Store Information, Contact Information and Google Map. \n\n\n\n\n\u2713 Fill store\u2019s name, shipping fee, address and description in \nStore Information\n session. You can select tags if you want your customers can search this store by tags.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTips:\n* You can input content for the \nDescription** field in HTML for better display in frontend, such as customized format, attached links.\n\n\n\u2713 In \nContact Form\n session, it allows you to enter information of store\u2019s manager such as email address, phone number, etc. so customers will know how to contact if needed. You can configure to enable automatic emails sent to the store manager when pickup orders\u2019 status is changed.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nYou can also upload store images to show on the \nStore Detailed\n page. The image chosen as Base Image is used on the \nStore Listing\n page as well.\n\n\n\u2713   \nGoogle Map\n session, you can fill in coordinates and set color of the store\u2019s pin shown on Google map, which is very helpful as you can highlight any store from others just with a different pin color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Schedule\n tab: \n\n \n\n\n\n\nWhen customers want to pick up products at a specific store, they need to know the suitable time to arrive. This tab helps you set store\u2019s opening time for that purpose. Let\u2019s take Monday for example:\n\n\n-If your store opens on Monday, choose Yes for Open.\n\n\n-If your store opens from 6 am to 11 am and 1pm to 22 pm, set \nOpening Time\n as 6:00, \nLunch break starts at\n 11:00, \nLunch break ends\n at 13:00 and \nClosing Time\n as 22:00.\n\n\n-When customers select their pickup time at checkout, you can set the interval between options, such as 30 minutes. Then the shipping time options shown in the dropdown box are 7:00, 7:30, 8:30, etc.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can set opening hours for each remaining day of the week. To quickly set up, click on the \nApply to other days\n button on the top right corner of the Monday section. Other days will have the same working time as Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Messages\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nWhen customers fill in the Contact Form on the Store Detailed page, all messages are saved in this tab allowing admin/ store manager to review later.\n\n\n\n\nAfter entering all required information, click on the \nSave Store\n or \nSave And Continue Edit\n buttons to create the store.\n\n\nImport Store\n\n\nClick on the \nImport Store\n button on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page. You will be navigated to the \nImport File\n page.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV file structure\n\nYou can download the sample \u201cstores.csv\u201d file to view its structure. The columns are attribute values of the store and each row corresponds to one store. The title row (first row) contains the attribute name; you can note it (important!) because the system reads data from CSV files based on the name. If the attribute value of any stores is null, you don\u2019t have to fill data in to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImport file\n\n\n\n\nCreate a CSV file with information of your store following the sample file structure\n\n\nClick on button \nChoose File\n to select  your  CSV file\n\n\nSelect \nSave Store\n to import the CSV file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Store\n\n\nOn the \nStore Manager\n grid, you click on any store to edit. Besides 3 tabs when you create a new store, you can see more \nRelated Orders\n tab.\n\n\n*Note:\n\n\nWhen a store is imported or created manually, the system will automatically get the coordinates based on the store address by using Google API. However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the \nGoogle Map\n tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.\n\n\nYou can see it at the left upper.

They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.  In order to get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1 : Visit APIs Console at \nhttps://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click  Create project  button on top of the menu.    Step 2 : Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3 : On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials T ab.

Let me give you an example.\n\n\nCustomer\u2019s order value is $606.04\n\n\n\n\nYour customer wants to pay $400 in Cash In. Then, you fill in the blank space \nCash In\n with the value of $400.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the remaining ($206.04), your customer wants to pay by Custom payment 1. So, at this time, you click on the \nAdd Payment\n button and choose \nCustom payment 1\n. The remaining amount ($206.04) will be automatically filled in the box.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\n:\n\n\n\n\nSupport multiple payment methods for one order\n\n\nNot require Cash in method as compulsory\n\n\nYou can save payment method code to order if you do not use split payment (updated)\n\n\n\n\nProcess part of order payment (partial payment)\n\n\nWith Web POS, you can also apply partial payment that allows customers to pay part of the order value. For example, your customer wants to reserve the good before it will be launched. His order value is $606.04. He pays $300 as reservation.\n\n\n\n\nWhen processing payment, choose \nCash In\n with the value of $300. Then, instead of filling the remained values in other payment methods, you click on button \nMark as partial\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter finishing creating order, in the next step, when customers come back to pay the rest of order value, you open that order\u2019s details in \nOrder History\n tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check the total due is $306.04 and the total paid is $300. To complete the order payment, you click on \nTake payment\n button. Tick to choose the payment option or pay with multiple ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n-   After filling in the due amount, click on \nSubmit\n button to complete the payment action. Then the total paid is equal to the whole order\u2019s value.\n\n\nHow to keep orders on hold for further processing\n\n\nYour customers can't make up their minds yet, or are unable to make a payment meanwhile? They may want to purchase items that are for pre-order or currently out of stocks? You don't want to lose those potential customers, don't you? Then, Web POS's new feature can put these orders on hold - no limit in time - until they are ready to continue processing!\n\n\nAfter adding products to cart, you can choose \nHold\n to put the order into \nOn-hold Orders\n section. A \nNote for holding order\n will appear for inserting any comment that you would like to keep, for example, \u201cWaiting for payment\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nTo check orders that have been put on hold, select \nOn-hold Orders\n section. List of on-hold orders is recorded with certain note for each order.

Remember that you must be online and have permission to do these actions.\n\n\n\n\nThe receipt will look like the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\nAnd here is the email of order information:\n\n\n\n\nHow to review orders\n\n\n \n\nIn POS screen, you can review orders by choosing \nOrder History\n tab.

In case, you cannot do it yourself, please purchase our installation service. \n\n\nIntegration with QuickBooks Online\n\n\nAfter installing successfully, you will have QuickBooks Integration tab in your Magento backend. The tab includes 3 functions which are Sync Entities Management, Sync Logs, and Settings. \n\n\nNow, you need to integrate your Magento 1 store with your QuickBooks Online account by navigating to \nQuickBooks Integration > Settings\n. The page will appear as follow:   \n\n\n\n\nWhen you create QuickBooks app, you will be provided with the app key. If you haven\u2019t known how to get it, please see this link. Then you need to come back to \nQuickBooks Integration -> Settings\n to edit. \n\n\n\n\nAll you need to do is to copy and paste the key into the required field in Magento backend (OAUTH Consumer Key & OAUTH Consumer Secret). \n\n\nChoose Default Asset Acount, Default Income Account, Default Express Account, Tax Agency.\n\n\n\n\nThen, click on \nConnect to QuickBooks\n button to integrate with your QuickBooks Online.\n\n\nA new page is opened. Sign in if you already have an account to authorize Magestore to connect to Intuit before you can exchange data with it. \n\n\n\n\nIf you haven\u2019t have an account yet, you can sign up to create a new one: \n\n\n\n\nAfter sign in QuickBooks Online account successfully, click on \nAuthorize\n button to finish connection process.\n\n\n\n\nWhen your Magento 1 store is successfully connected with QuickBooks Online, click on \nSave Config\n button before continuing, this will help you avoid making the error.  \n\n\n\n\nSync Entities Management\n\n\nGo to \nQuickBooks Integration > Sync Entities Management\n. This is a page where manages all data synchronized from Magento to QuickBooks Online including Customers, Category, Product, Order, Invoice, Tax, Payment method, Credit memo, Product quantity. You can choose the way to synchronize data either \nUpdate on Save\n or \nManual Update\n. \n\n\n\n\nUpdate on save mode:\n Data will be automatically synced from Magento to QuickBooks online.  \n\n\nManual update mode:\n If you wish to sync data right away, you can press Re-Sync data button.\n\nNote:\n \n\n\nThe data synchronizing process will take some time, the length of\n   time depends on the size of database.  \n\n\nProduct quantity is in Manual update mode, which helps store owners keep selling online even when the product is out of stock. However, you can change the sync mode or re-sync data in mass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, with these data synchronized, there will be error notifications which happen during the data synchronizing process. You can view error details by clicking the notification.\n\n\nSync Logs\n\n\nNavigate to \nQuickBooks Integration > Sync Logs\n. In the QuickBooks API log management, you can check all the errors that occur during the data synchronizing process. The error is shown with error message and code if the API request has errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work\n\n\nAutomatically sync Customers from Magento 1 to QuickBooks online\n\n\nIn order to manage customers in Magento store, you go to \nCustomers > Manage customers\n. When a new account is registered in frontend of Magento 1 or an existing customer is updated, for example: \n\n\n\n\nQuickBooks Integration extension will allow synchronizing this record automatically to your QuickBooks Online. You can check this record by navigating to \nSales > Customers\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically sync Products from Magento 1 to Quickbooks online\n\n\nWhen admins create or update information of products in Magento 1 store in \nCatalog > Manage Products\n:\n\n\n\n\nThen, data will be automatically synced into QuickBooks Online items. The data are synchronized including product\u2019s name, SKU, quantity, category, price and more.\n\n\nTo check this record on QuickBooks Online, click on the Gear icon, then click on \nProducts and Services\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that there is a difference between product types of Magento and QuickBooks. Product types of QuickBooks are divided into four types: \n\n\n\n\nInventory:\n Products you buy and/or sell and that you track quantities\n   of \n\n\nNon-inventory:\n Products you buy and/or sell but you don\u2019t need to (or can\u2019t) track quantities of, for example, nuts and bolts used in an installation.\n\n\nServices:\n Services that you provide to customer, for example, landscaping or tax preparation services. \n\n\nBundles:\n A collection of products and/or services that you sell together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically sync Product Quantity from Magento 1 to QuickBooks online and vice versa\n\n\nQuickBooks Integration will allow automatically synchronizing Product Quantity in QuickBooks if there is any change from your Magento 1 store. This will help you manage the inventory in the best way. You can choose sync mode for Product quantity sync either \nManual update\n or \nUpdate on Save\n. \n\n\nIn order to track product quantities, from QuickBooks homepage click on the Gear icon. Next select \nAccount and Settings\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure your settings are ready for Inventory tracking. From the \nAccount & Settings\n page, click \nSales\n in the left menu. Make sure that \n\u201cTrack quantity and price/rate\u201d\n and \n\u201ctrack inventory quantity on hand\u201d\n are set to \nOn\n:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically sync Categories and Sub-categories from Magento 1 to QuickBooks Online\n\n\nCategories allow you to more easily find your products. You can create categories and sub-categories from \nCatalog > Manage Categories\n.

Manage Credit Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\n\n\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n* and \ncredit balance.\n**\n\n\nb.    Send Credit to Friends\n\n\n\n\nPath:\n \nMy Dashboard\n page \n> My Credit\n tab \n> Send Credit\n tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page as above. \n\n\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit to Friends\n and \nCredit Code List.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n: allows customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit Code List\n: shows all information about the credit codes that customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient\u2019s email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\nCase 1\n: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\n\n\n(1) Enter recipient\u2019s email\n\n\n(2) Add an amount that customers want to send to their friends.\n\n\n(3) Write a message to the recipient. \n\n\n(4) Click on Send button\n\n\nNotice that after entering recipient\u2019s email, our module will check that email address and show a notification to customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code anymore.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated, and the \nCancel\n link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \nRedeem Credit\n for more information. \n\n\nCustomers can also check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email. \n\n\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section. \n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 2\n: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you configure that customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the \nSend\n button, they will receive an email as above.\n\n\nAt the same time, they will be navigated to the \nVerify\n page.\n\n\nOn this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the \nCredit Code List,\n that code is put under the \u201c\nAwaiting verification\n\u201d status with a \nVerify\n link. \n\n\n\n\nTo verify, customers can:\n\n\n(1)  Enter the verification code they received in their emails \n\n\n(2) Click on the \nSubmit Code\n button.\n\n\nAfter customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.\n\n\nc.    Redeem Credit\n\n\n\n\nPath:\n \nMy Dashboard\n page \n> My Credit\n tab \n> Redeem Credit\n tab\n\n\n\n\nTo go to the \nRedeem Credit\n page, customers can click on the \nRedeem Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\nOn this page, customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance as following steps:\n\n\n\n\n(1) Enter the code in the text field \n\n\n(2) Clicking on the \nRedeem\n button.\n\n\nAnother way is just to click on the link in the email. \n\n\nAfter redeeming code, customers can check their current balance and transaction in the \nTransaction History\n section. \n\n\n\n\nHow to check out by Credit\n\n\nCustomers can use credit to check out on both \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout\n page. \n\n\nOn the \nShopping Cart\n page, our module will add \nApply Credit Discount\n block for customers to use their credit balances at checkout. \n\n\n\n\nTo use a credit amount, customers can:\n\n\n(1) Enter that number in the field \n\n\n(2) Click on the \nApply\n button and then our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of the order.\n\n\nPlease note that customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the \nCustomer Credit\n block as below.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout\n page, in the \nPayment Information\n tab, apply credit discount the same as in the \nShopping Cart\n page. \n\n\n\n\n(1) Enter an amount of credit \n\n\n(2) Click on the \nApply\n button, and then our module will auto-update the order\u2019s Grand Total.\n\n\nAfter the order has been placed, customers\u2019 credit balances will be updated immediately.

Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When customers click on, they will be shown clearly.

Case 1 : Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.   (1) Enter recipient\u2019s email  (2) Add an amount that customers want to send to their friends.  (3) Write a message to the recipient.   (4) Click on Send button  Notice that after entering recipient\u2019s email, our module will check that email address and show a notification to customers.

After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.   As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.  At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the  Credit Code List  section as below.   In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the  Cancel  link in the  Action  column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code anymore.  Otherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated, and the  Cancel  link will be disabled.

He pays $100 as reservation. \n-  When processing payment, choose  Web POS \u2013 Cash In  with the value of $100 and the rest with COD (or other payment methods as you wish). \n-  After finishing creating order, in the next step, don\u2019t create invoice or shipment for this order.

Go to \nSystem/Cache Management\n. Select all caches and take action \nRefresh\n then submit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to \nSystem/Configuration\n.

The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the extension in back-end.\n\n\nNew release:\n One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.\n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. \n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1:\n Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2:\n Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3:\n On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials\n Tab. \n\n\nClick this tab and after that, a box will appear with \nAPI key\n on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose \nBrowser key\n \n\n\n\n\nStep 4:\n Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5:\n Get the key and paste it in your page \n\n\n\n\nStep 6:\n After all, in \nLibrary\n tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nHoliday Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Holidays >\n click on \nAdd Holiday\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nHoliday Name, Store, Starting Date, End Date\n and \nComment\n - which is shown as notification to customers\n\n\n(2) Remember to click \nSave Item\n if you\u2019ve done or \nSave and Continue Edit\n to avoid losing what you\u2019ve written. \n\n\nOR ELSE, you can click on \nReset\n to delete all you\u2019ve created or \nBack\n to delete all and come back to the Manage Holiday Page.\n\n\nSpecial Day Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Special Days >\n click on \nAdd Special Day\n\n\n\n\n(1) Fill in \nSpecial Day Name\n and select \nStore, Starting Date, End Date\n\n\n(2) \nTimer Interval:\n Set Time Interval between 2 shipping times\n\n\n(3) \nOpening Time\n and \nClosing Time:\n choose working time for special day\n\n\n(4) \nComment:\n enter comment which will be shown as notification to your customers. \n\n\nRemember to click \nSave\n to finish\n\n\nTag Setting\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Tags >\n click on \nAdd Tag\n\n\n\n\n(1) \nName:\n Enter the name\n\n\n(2) \nTag Icon: Choose File\n to upload Icon\n\n\n(3) \nStatus:\n choose \nEnabled\n to activate the tag\n\n\nShipment Method\n\n\nPath: \nSystem > Configuration > Sales > Shipping Methods > Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n(1) You can edit these fields as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabled:\n choose \nYes\n to activate Web POS Shipping\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrier title:\n enter the carrier title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod title:\n enter the method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice:\n enter the price of this method/service (Once you edit, the price will be default)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(2) \nCustome Methods:\n\n\nYou can have another option for Web POS Shipping by creating as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Title: \n enter the name of method title\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom Method Price: \n enter the price of the Custom Method.

If you don\u2019t receive the email, you can directly login to your account dashboard at MageStore then go to  My Account/My License Certificates . Here you will select your  Order number  and a corresponding  Product  then type the  back-end domain of your live site . It is optional to add your Development Domains right or later. Click on the  Generate Certificate  button to get your  License Certificate.  Note:   License Certificate  is a PDF document that contains your License Information including your Product Name, License Serial, License Type, Registered Domain, Expiration date, etc. Your  License Serial  is unique and can only be used once for one module. You can go to MageStore  Check License Information  page, enter your License Serial to check your license status. You can also view your License Information in back-end when your module installation is finished.    Go to  My Downloadable Products . Choose the version of the module then download it. The file that you download is normally a zip file.    It\u2019s required to enable cache in the administration panel of your site. Go to  System/Cache Management . Choose all caches and click on  Enable  then submit.    Use FTP client (such as Filezilla, WinSCP, cuteFtp) to upload or copy all folders in the zip package to your Magento site root folder. This will not overwrite any existing file; just add new files to the folder structure.    After uploading is done, log in your Magento administration panel to refresh cache. Go to  System/Cache Management . Select all caches and take action  Refresh  then submit.    Navigate to  System/Configuration . If you can see the module tab, it is installed properly.    Now if you get access denied error when click on the module tab, you need to log out admin panel and log in again.    Go to front-end and try to process, make sure that everything is OK. Note:  In the case that you have followed all above steps but couldn\u2019t make the module work properly, to make your website function as normal, you can delete the file or change the module\u2019s filename module in  app/etc/magestore_module_name.xml  (for example, change  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml  to  Magestore_Affiliateplus.xml.bka  ).

New release:  One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.  This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.   However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advise all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\nTo get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1:  Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click Create project button on top of the menu.    Step 2:  Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3:  On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials  Tab.   Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with  API key  on it. It is where you should click to create API key for your browser apps.   After that you will see a box with number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. Choose  Browser key     Step 4:  Fill in your name and domain and then click create   Step 5:  Get the key and paste it in your page    Step 6:  After all, in  Library  tab, enable the APIs in red frame as below",

They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.\n\n\nHowever, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.\n\n\nManage Store\n\n\nPath: \nStore Pickup > Manage Stores\n\n\nThe \nStore Manager\n grid shows all stores created in your system with their address and status.

There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, the range of values and drop-down values. \n\n\n\n\n1.   Fixed Value\n: These credit products have a fixed value. \n\n\n\n\n2.   Drop-down Values\n: With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.\n\n\n\n\n3.   The range of Values\n: With this type, customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in the backend. \n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the customer\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by doing the following steps: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTick \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox \n\n\nEnter the name of the recipient \n\n\nEnter the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address\n\n\n\n\nEnter the message that recipient will receive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 2\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath: \nMy Dashboard\n page \n> My Credit\n tab\n\n\n\n\nTo buy credit product, click on the \nMy Credit\n on the left navigation of the \nAccount Dashboard\n page.\n\n\n\n\nIn this second way, customers will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button. Then, the Credit Products page will be displayed and customers can continue buying credit as mentioned steps in option 1 above. \n\n\nWhen the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 1\n: if the recipient does not have an account in the system, an email as above will be sent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase 2\n: if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the sender always gets email notifications as above.\n\n\nHow to manage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nPath: \nMy Dashboard\n page \n> My Credit\n tab \n\n\na. Manage Credit Balance\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\n\n\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction and credit balance.\n\n\nb. Send Credit to Friends\n\n\nPath: \nMy Dashboard\n page \n> My Credit\n tab \n> Send Credit\n tab\n\n\n\n\nFirst, customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page as above. \n\n\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit to Friends\n and \nCredit Code List.\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n: allows customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information\n\n\nCredit Code List\n: shows all information about the credit codes that customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient\u2019s email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\n\n\nCase 1\n: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter recipient\u2019s email\n\n\nAdd an amount that customers want to send to their friends.\n\n\nWrite a message to the recipient. \n\n\nClick on \nSend\n button\n\n\n\n\nNotice that after entering recipient\u2019s email, our module will check that email address and show a notification to customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below.  \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent.

Particularly, they could pay a part of bill by cash and other part will be paid by credit card.     For example: This order values $249 and customer wants to pay $50 in cash. Then you have to enter this number in the field of \u201cWeb POS- Cash in\u201d and the remain money will be calculated automatically for you.    To solve \u201cRemain money\u201d, you can click on  Add Payment  button on the left corner of the screen    After clicking on  Add Payment , Customers have those options to pay for the remaining money  For instance, Customer chooses \u201cWeb POS \u2013 Credit Card\u201d and the system will be displayed like this:    And then, please tap on  Place Order  button to complete this order. The process is done.   Notes: \n-  Support multiple payment methods for one order \n-  Not require Cash-in method as compulsory  b. For Partial Payment  This function allows customers to pay a part of value first and other parts will be paid later in different interval. Especially when customers want to reserve goods before it\u2019s arrived at store, they could leave a deposit and they will complete the bill after having product in their hand.   For example, the total value is $249, and customers want to pay $50 first and $199 they will pay later    Enter 50$ in the field of \u201cWeb POS \u2013 Cash in\u201d  Tap on  MARK AS PARTIAL   And when customers come back to pay completely the bill, staff can check this order by checking  Orders History  tab (path: from WebPOS frontend top left menu icon  > Orders  section  > Orders History ).    I will take another example for you like this:    This order is remaining $199 that the customer hasn\u2019t paid yet.   And when he comes back to accomplish this order, staff could tap  Take payment  and choose payment method for customer to pay in the popup as below:   Staff can keep on adding  more payment methods as they want by clicking on  Add more Payment Method .

There are three types of credit products for customers to choose: fixed values, the range of values and drop-down values.    1.   Fixed Value : These credit products have a fixed value.    2.   Drop-down Values : With this type, customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.   3.

After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.   As you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.  At the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the  Credit Code List  section as below.     In this section, customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent.

Customers can check their current balances and transactions in the  Transaction History  section.    At the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction.     Case 2 : Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.    If you configure that customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the  Send  button, they will receive an email as above.  At the same time, they will be navigated to the  Verify  page.  On this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement.
