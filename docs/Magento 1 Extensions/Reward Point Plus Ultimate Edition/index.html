</li>
<li>
<p><strong>General Information</strong> Tab:
<img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image096.png?raw=true" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> tab:
This tab allows you to configure the conditions of products to which the rule is applicable.
For example, you want to apply this rule only for products named Ottoman; you can configure the condition as in the image below:
<img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image097.png?raw=true" />
If you do not configure this field, the rule will be applied for all products.
Also, you can configure how Customers can spend points in the <strong>Action</strong> field. There are two options for you to choose:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discount for every X points:</strong>
For example, if you want to configure that Customers need to spend at least 5 points on products:
•   Choose "Action": "Discount for every X points" 
•   Fill in field "Points (X)": 5 
=&gt; With every 5 points customers spent, they can receive a corresponding discount. For example, 5 points can be spent to get $1, 10 points can get $2 and so on</p>
<pre><code>- **Spend X points for every Y amount of Price:**
</code></pre>
<p>For example, if you want to configure that Customers need to spend 5 points on every $200.00 of product price and limit the required number of points to 15, then:
        •   Choose "Action": "Spend X Points for every Y amount of price"
        •   Fill in field "Points (X)": 5 
        •   Fill in field "Money Step (Y)": 200 
        •   Fill in field "Max points required to spend": 15 
        =&gt; If the price of the product is $800.00, Customers can use 15 or 30 or 45 points for 1 or 2 or 3 times of discount to buy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> tab:
In the Action tab, you can configure how prices of products are discounted after Customers use points:
<img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image098.png?raw=true" />
There are four discount types:
        - By Fixed Amount
        - To Fixed Amount
        - By Percentage of the original price
        - To Percentage of the original price
Let’s take an example, to give a discount of $10 or to $10 for every X points and apply the discount 5 times maximum per product, you can configure as below:
•   Choose “Discount Type”: "By a fixed amount" or "To a fixed amount" 
•   Fill in field "Discount Amount": 10 
•   Fill in field "Uses Allowed Per Product": 5
=&gt; With the discount "By a fixed amount" of $10.00 and "Uses Allowed Per Product" equal to 5, a $200.00 product will have its price down to $90.00 for the first time of spending points, to$180.00 for the second time and so on until reaching $150.00 for the last time (5th time).</p>

<p>Then you will be redirected to the Shopping Cart Spending Rule Manager page.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add a new Rule:</strong>
First you should click on the <strong>Add Rule</strong> button. And then you should configure information in 3 tabs:</li>
<li><strong>General Information</strong> Tab:
<img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image101.png?raw=true" /></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Conditions</strong> tab:
This tab allows you to configure the conditions of shopping carts to which the rule is applicable.
For example, you want to apply this rule only for shopping carts of subtotals equal to or greater than $300, you can configure the condition as in the image below:
<img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image102.png?raw=true" />
If you do not set up this field, the rule will be applied for all carts.
Also, you can configure how Customers can spend points in the <strong>Action</strong> field. There are two options for you to choose:</p>
<pre><code>- **Give discount for fixed X points**: Customer can ONLY spend X points on whatever order they place.
</code></pre>
<p>For example, If you want to allow Customers to spend 5 points only on a shopping cart to get the discount, then you can configure as below:
•   Choose "Action": "Give discount for fixed X points" 
•   Fill in field "Points (X)": 5
=&gt; If Customers place an order of $500.00 or $800.00, they can spend only 5 points in both cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Give discount for every X points</strong>: Customers can receive discounts proportionally to the number of points they spent.
If you want to give discount for every 5 points Customers spend on the order and limit the number of points that can be used to 15, then:
•   Choose "Action": "Give discount for every X points" 
•   Fill in field "Points (X)": 5 
•   Fill in field " Max points spent by this rule": 15 
=&gt; With every 5 points customers spent, they can receive a corresponding discount. For example, 5 points can be spent to get $1, 10 points can get $2.00 and so on. But they cannot use more than 15 points as that is the max points that can be spent by this rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Actions</strong> tab:
In the <strong>Action</strong> tab, you can configure how prices of products are discounted after Customers use points:
There are two discount types:
        -    Fixed amount discount for whole cart
        - Percentage amount discount for whole cart</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take an example, if you want to give a discount of $10 or 10% for X points (configured in the <strong>Conditions</strong> tab), then you can configure as below:</p>
<p>•   Choose "Action": "Fixed discount amount for the whole cart" or "Percent discount amount for the whole cart" 
•   Fill in field "Discount Amount": 10 
=&gt; An order of $200.00 can be discounted to $190.00 with action "Fixed discount amount for the whole cart" or to $180.00 with action "Percent discount amount for the whole cart". </p>
<p>Besides, you can configure the condition of products on shopping cart to apply the rule.
For example, if you want to apply the rule only for orders having products belonging to the furniture category, you can set up the data as in the image below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%201%20Extensions/image_Reward%20Points%20Plus%20Ultimate%20Edition/image103.png?raw=true" /></p>
