<h3 id="1-stock-listing">1. Stock Listing</h3>
<p>After installation, the system will automatically provide a Primary Warehouse. This Primary Warehouse cannot be deleted but can only be edited. All the existing products will be automatically synced from your website to this warehouse before you can assign to another warehouse. 
This function consists of 3 tabs to help you manage your inventory successfully:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stock in Warehouse</strong>: provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses or in a specific warehouse</li>
<li><strong>Non-warehouse Products</strong>: lists out a newly-created product which has not been assigned to any warehouse</li>
<li><strong>Warehouses</strong>: allows you to view and edit details of your warehouses</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="11-stock-in-warehouse">1.1. Stock in Warehouse</h4>
<p>This tab provides an overview of stocks in all warehouses. Here you can view stock SKU, Name, Price, Qty in Warehouse(s), Qty to Ship, Available Qty, Products in Warehouse(s), Stock Movement and Product Status. 
The extension provides an in-depth control over your <strong>composite products</strong> (configurable, bundle and grouped products).  You can see 3 quantity types of each variation or component of the composite product in a specific warehouse. 
For example, if you have a configurable product whose root SKU is Pwt007, you can see the quantities of each available size. If you sell products which often have different sizes and colors like clothing, this is an efficient way to control your inventory. </p>
<p>(image 1)</p>
<p>Note that there are 3 types of quantity shown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qty in Warehouse(s)</strong>: total amount of products in physical warehouses;</li>
<li><strong>Qty to ship</strong>: the number of products which has been ordered and is ready to be shipped;</li>
<li>Available Qty: the amount of products left in the virtual catalog which is available to sell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>Qty in Warehouse(s) = Qty to Ship + Available Qty</strong></p>
<p>You can select a warehouse in the drop-down list and the stock details in that particular warehouse will be displayed. </p>
<p>(image 2)</p>
<p>Update the total quantity and Shelf Location easily on the Inventory grid in only 3 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Select the product(s);</li>
<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Input the new Qty in Warehouse(s) and/or Shelf Location;</li>
<li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click “Update Stock”.</li>
</ul>
<p>(image 3)</p>
<p><strong>Shelf Allocation</strong> is a useful information to find the product in the physical stock quickly, especially in fulfilling customer’s order.
In addition, you can edit available qty of products in each Warehouse &amp; Global by accessing to <strong>Catalog &gt; Manage Products</strong></p>
<p>(image 4)</p>
<p>Then, click on Products you want to edit available Qty, go to <strong>Inventory &gt; Qty</strong> &gt; Tick on <strong>Force edit</strong></p>
<p>(image 5)</p>
<h4 id="12-non-warehouse-products">1.2. Non-warehouse Products</h4>
<p>When a product is newly-created and has not been assigned to any warehouse yet, it will automatically be allocated in this Non-warehouse list. From here, you can select a product and add it into a specific warehouse.</p>
<p>(image 6)</p>
<h4 id="13-warehouses">1.3. Warehouses</h4>
<p>The <strong>Warehouses</strong> page displays each warehouse’s details such as its ID, name, total SKUs and total product quantities in each warehouse, contact email/ tel./ address. 
The <strong>Inventory Management</strong> rebuilt allows synchronization between the warehouse and its Magento front store. This means when you edit information or product quantity of a warehouse, this information will automatically be updated in that warehouse’s front store and visible to customers. 
You can enable this function in <strong>Settings.</strong></p>
<p>(image 7)</p>
<p>You can assign multiple Magento store views to one Warehouse by clicking on “<strong>Mapping Location – Warehouses</strong>” button</p>
<p>(image 8)</p>
<p>You can also create unlimited new warehouses by hitting the “<strong>Add a New Warehouse</strong>” button.</p>
<p>(image 9)</p>
<p>In addition, by clicking on each warehouse, you can access 5 tabs as below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>General Information</strong>: records basic details of the warehouse such as Name, Code, Contact Email, Address, etc. If you enable the “<strong>Link warehouse to Magento front store view</strong>” setting above, this is where you can select the warehouse’s linked front store.
(image 10)</li>
<li><strong>Stock On Hand</strong>: lists out all existing products in the warehouse. Clicking on each product will let you promptly revise its total Qty in the specific Warehouse and its Shelf Location. </li>
</ul>
<p>On this section, if you click on any warehouses, there will have “<strong>Export</strong>” button along with CSV/Excel XML file.</p>
<p>(image 11)</p>
<p>If you want to add a product into a warehouse, you should go to <strong>Catalog &gt; Manage Product</strong> in your Magento core backend.</p>
<p>(image 12)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stock Movement</strong>: provides stock changing record of the warehouse. Information includes added/ subtracted quantity, product SKU, movement type, movement date and reference number to access further details by a click.</li>
<li><strong>Warehouse Permission</strong>: lets you assign and manage staff account permission. Here you can set staff permission by clicking at the “Assign Staffs” button at the right of the page. 
(image 13)
An <strong>Assign Staff</strong> window will appear as in the screenshot below. Just select the staff and his/her role, click “<strong>Add Selected Staff</strong>” button and you are done!
(image 14)

</ul>
<p>(image 15)</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL GUIDE: Manage User/ Staff Roles and Permissions</strong>
If you want to create and/or edit user roles and permissions in different sections in the Inventory Management, go to the “<strong>Permission</strong>” submenu under the “<strong>System</strong>” menu of the Magento core backend.</p>
<p>(image 16)</p>
<p>The “<strong>User</strong>” tab lists out all users with details like ID, Username, First name, Last name, Email and Status of the account. Create a new user by clicking a button at the top right of the page.</p>
<p>(image 17)</p>
<p>Admin can view, edit and remove staff permission by clicking on each user. Admin can also assign a warehouse to a user here.</p>
<p>(image 18)</p>
<p>The “<strong>Roles</strong>” tab lets you see a  list  of  role  and  create  a  new  role  for  users. </p>
<p>(image 19)</p>
<p>In “<strong>Role Info</strong>” tab, you need to input the role name, verify the admin’s password. Then select the checkbox of the role’s permissions in the drop-down list, or select “<strong>All</strong>” in the “<strong>Resource Access</strong>” option to grant full permission to the role. When done, hit “<strong>Save Role</strong>” to finish.</p>
<p>(image 20)</p>

</ul>
<p>(image 21)</p>
