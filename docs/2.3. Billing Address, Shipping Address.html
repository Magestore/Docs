<p>If Customers have already logged in, they can skip the <strong>Shipping Address</strong> section as their information is automatically added. If Customers want to change shipping address, select <strong>New Address</strong> and change the information.</p>
<p class="img-container"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magestore/docs/master/OSC2/Image/How-to-use/osc2-use-7.png" alt="Customers can change or fill in new shipping address"></p>
<p>In case of not logging in, they will see fields to fill in: First name, Last name, Address...as you configured in backend.
After providing a shipping address, if Customers want to create bill to another address, they can unselect the box <strong>My billing and shipping address are the same</strong> then fill information in the <strong>Billing Address</strong> section.</p>

<p>In both <strong>Billing Address</strong> and <strong>Shipping Address</strong> sections, when Customers type some first characters of their address, the system will show matching results suggested by Google.</p>

<p>Customers just need to select a correct option and then, other fields such as <strong>City, Country, Zip Code, State/Province</strong> will be automatically filled out.</p>

<p>When there is any change in <strong>Shipping Address</strong> and <strong>Billing Address</strong> sections, <strong>Shipping Method, Payment Method</strong> and <strong>Order Review</strong> will be updated right away without reloading the page. Why is this feature useful? Let us give an example. A Customer may consider between 2 shipping addresses. He can see right on the checkout page that for 1 address, shipping fee is cheaper and payment method can be Cash On Delivery, but with the other address, just money transfer and advanced payment are accepted.</p>
