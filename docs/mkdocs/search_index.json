Any unauthorized reproduction of this document is prohibited.\n\n\nThis document and the information it contains constitute a trade secret of Magestore and may not be reproduced or disclosed to non-authorized users without the prior written permission from Magestore. Permitted reproductions, in whole or in part, shall bear this notice.\n\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n\n\n\nBarcode by definition is the small image of lines (bars) and spaces that is affixed to retail store items, identification cards, and postal mail to identify a particular product number, person, or location. The code uses a sequence of vertical bars and spaces to represent numbers and other symbols. Barcode is a reliable method for cutting costs and savingtime for business.\n\n\nBarcode management extension from Magestore provides your business with a handful solution to generate barcode, print barcode label and scan barcode, all in one.\n\n\n2. How it works\n\n\n\n\n2.1. Barcode listing\n\n\nBarcode listing is a view to display all barcodes of all products saved in Inventory Management. It contains Barcode, SKU, Supplier and Purchased Time.\n\n\nFrom this screen, admin can instantly take actions like importing or generating barcode with 5 buttons on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nAdmin can also view details of each product and barcode. \n\n\n\n\nFrom barcode detailed page, admin can configure barcode printing and print barcode directly. Product information is shown including Image, name, price and its availability in each warehouse.\n\n\n2.2. Generate barcode\n\n\nInventory Management gives you 2 modes to generate barcode:\n- One barcode per product SKU\n- Multiple barcodes per product SKU\nThis can be configured in Barcode Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d, then the system will allow you to generate only one barcode for one product SKU.\nNow to generate barcode, you go to Generate Barcodes tab. From here you can select the product that you want to generate barcode, fill in the Supplier (optional) then generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product SKU\u201d as \u201cNo\u201d, then it opens up 2 options to generate barcode when you go to Generate Barcodes tab.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate Barcode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2 options are: Generate barcode per item or Generate barcode per purchase.\n\u201cGenerate barcode per item\u201d means each item will have its own identified barcode although they have the same SKU.\n\n\n\u201cGenerate barcode per purchase\u201d means items will be identified by the time it is purchased. Although you take 10 items with same SKU in one time purchasing from supplier, these 10 items will have the same barcode. But in another time of purchase, they will have different barcode.\n\n\nAfter selecting the option you want to proceed with, you can continue selecting product, fill the product Qty., supplier and purchased time (optional) then generate. \n\n\nAdmin can configure the barcode pattern to generate. Barcodes generated will be saved in Barcode listing page & Barcode creating history.\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Import barcode\n\n\nWhen you generate barcodes in mass, you will not need to use Generate barcode feature. Instead, you can import barcode directly into the system using the \nImport barcode\n feature of Inventory Management.\n\n\nThe system provides a sample import file including SKU, Barcode, Qty. and Supplier & Purchase time (optional).\n\n\n\n\nAfter preparing the file as in the sample file, now you can upload the file, fill the reason and start to import.\n\n\n2.4. Barcode label template\n\n\nYou can create your own barcode template by adding new template. There are also 3 most used templates as default templates in the extension: \nA4\n, \nJewelry\n and \nStandard\n for you to select.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure paper width and height, label width and height, font size\u2026and preview the template before saving. \n\n\n\n\n2.5. Print barcode\n\n\nIn Barcode configuration, admin can select the barcode template from the templates created before to print. \n\n\n\n\nAdmin can select multiple barcodes to print at once. Or click to \nView\n under Action column to print one barcode multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n2.6. Scan barcode\n\n\nIn Inventory Management extension, you need to use a Barcode scanner which is able to connect with your computer. Then you can scan to read product information or update stock Qty. when doing Stock taking (Stock taking is a feature available in Inventory Management extension) or managing purchase orders (Magestore Barcode management extension is totally compatible with Magestore Inventory Management & Purchase Management extension.)\n\n\n\n\nWhen going to Scan Barcode, you can read barcode information and product information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Stock-taking, there are 5 steps: \n1- General information\n, \n2-Prepare products\n, \n3-Stock counting\n, \n4-Complete data entry\n, \n5-Complete Stocktaking\n. You can scan barcode to choose products in step 2-Prepare products and count stock quantity in step 3-Stock counting. (For more details of Physical Stock taking, please refer to Inventory Management user guide.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the end of Magento Barcode Management user guide, we hope this manual is useful for you.

Why not join this trend by creating Gift Card/ Gift Voucher as a 1-size- fits-all gift? With this extension, Customers can purchase Gift Cards to present others and then recipients can use them to buy products at your store. It\u2019s a great idea for helping you increase customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n2. How to use\n\n\n\n\nThis section demonstrates how Customers can use Gift Cards in frontend.\n\n\n2.1. Order a Gift Card Product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGift Card can be ordered as a normal product. Customers can enter or choose the value and quantity of Gift Card they want to order, then click on \nAdd to Cart\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of Gift Card product may differ from Gift Card value. It depends on Admin\u2019s configuration in backend, which could be a fixed value or a percentage of Gift Card value. If the price type is \u201cpercentage\u201d, Customers will see the corresponding Gift Card prices when they choose different Gift Card values.\n\n\nFor better Gift Card appearance, after choosing a preferred template, Customers can select between 1 of provided images. It is possible for Customers to personalize their Gift Card by uploading their own image as well. The recommended size for image to upload is 250x365px. 3 file types are supported including .GIF, .JPG and .PNG.\n  If Customers upload an image with an unsupported file type or the image is larger than the maximum file size configured by Admin, the system will auto-show an alert message to notify Customers. \n  Customers can also see the expiration date of the Gift Card on Gift Card image.\n\n\nFor Gift Card products that have usage conditions, the conditions will be displayed in a tooltip form when hovering over the hyperlink text as shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can also send Gift Cards to their friends by ticking \nSend Gift Card to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient\n\n\nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email which contains a Gift Card code to this address.\n\n\nCustom message\n: the message is delivered along with the Gift Card code.\n\n\nDay to send\n: Customers can set up the date and time zone that a Gift Card will besent.\n\n\nIf Customers want a Gift Card to be sent through a post office, they need to tick \nSend through post office\n checkbox. Gift Card product will be shipped as normal products.\n\n\nIf Customers want to get the notification email when their friend receives Gift Card,they need to tick the \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n\ncheckbox.\n\n\nTo preview how the Gift Card actually looks like when recipients receive, Customers can click on the Gift Card thumbnail image or the \nPreview Gift Card\n button. A popup of Gift Card interface will be shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n- After Customers add a Gift Card to cart and click on \nProceed to Checkout\n, they will be directed to the following page:\n    - \nWhen Customers send the Gift Card to their friend\n\n \n\n    - \nWhen Customers buy the Gift Card for themselves:\n\n \n\n\n\n\nThen Gift Cards products can be checked out as normal products. Customers will receive a Gift Card code if they buy for themselves. In case Customers purchase the\nGift Card to send to their friends, the code will be delivered to their friends\u2019 email with the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Sender has ticked the checkbox \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n, a notification will be sent to his email address immediately after the Gift Card is delivered to the friend\u2019s email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers purchase Gift Card for themselves, the notification email that they receive is as below:\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Manage Gift Card/Credit\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a voucher code, Customers can check their voucher balance and credit by clicking on \nGift Card\n tab on the navigator bar in \u201cMy account\u201d section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGift Card/Credit Management\n page will be shown as below; the gift code which Customers received will be automatically added to the list.\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can add a gift code which they received to the list or redeem it to their Gift Card credit balance. Next time when they order a product,they can use their credit balance without having to enter the gift code.\n\n\nCustomers need to click on \nAdd/Redeem a Gift Card\n button and enter the Gift Card code into the text field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Gift Card:\n\nCustomers need to click on Add To Your List button, this Gift Card will be added to the list and displayed as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGift Card list shows some information of Gift Cards such as: \ncode, balance, status,added date and action\n. Customers can view, print, redeem and remove their Gift Cards.\n\n\nGift code is mostly hidden to ensure the security for Customers. They can view a full gift code by clicking on each one.\n\n\nClicking on \nView\n link on \nAction\n column, Customers can view Gift Card detailed information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey can also redeem their Gift Card to the credit balance or remove it from a list by clicking on the corresponding link in Action column.\n\n\nIf Customers add the code which is sent to their friends, it will be highlighted as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRedeem a Gift Card:\n\nAfter entering the code, Customers need to click on \"Redeem Gift Card\" button. The value of the Gift Card will be redeemed to their Gift Card credit balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers are able to view the detailed information of their credit balance by clicking on \nView detail\n link. \nCredit Detail\n page is shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis page shows their current balance and their \nBalance history\n (Action, Balance Change, Gift Card code, Order, Balance, and Date).\n\n\n\n\n2.3. Use Gift Card/Credit to Place an Order\n\n\n\n\nWhen Customers have Gift Card codes or Gift Card credit balances, they can use them to get discount when ordering a product. There are two ways to use Gift Card code/credit balance:\n\n\n\n\nOn \nShopping Cart\n page:\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can choose to use credit or Gift Card by ticking either \nUse Gift Card credit to checkout\n or \nUse Gift Card to checkout\n checkbox or both.\n  - \nUse Gift Card credit to checkout\n: Customers need to enter an amount of money they want to use. After applying, this amount will be deducted from their Gift Car credit balance immediately.\n  - \nUse Gift Card to checkout\n: The system shows a box where Customers can enter gift codes. Besides, they can use gift codes they added to the list on \nGift Card/Credit Management\n page.\nAfter Customers click on \nApply Gift Card\n button, the Grand Total will be updated as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn \nCheckout\n page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can choose to use Gift Card or Gift Card credit and enter the amount of money as on \nShopping Cart\n page. Then click on \nAdd Gift Card\n button to apply.\n\n\nNote\n: Gift Card codes or Credit Card credit balances cannot be used to purchase Gift Card products but they can be spent on shipping fee, depending on Admin\u2019s settings.\n\n\n3.

You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the \nrange of values\n type.\nThe next step you need to do is selecting the type of Gift Card price, which could be 1 in 3 following options:\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n: Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.\n\n\nFixed number\n: Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field.\n\n\nPercent of Gift Card value\n: Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value as you configure in the next field.\nIf you choose the type of Gift Card price as \nFixed number\n or \nPercent of Gift Card value\n,\nremember to fill in the next field \nPrice/ Percentage\n to set the price for your Gift Card product.\nThe following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.\n\n\nType of Gift Card value\n: Dropdown values\n\n\nGift Card values\n: 20,30,40\n\n\nType of Gift Card price\n: Percent of Gift Card value\n\n\nPercentage\n: 90,90,90\nSo Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions\n tabs:\nThe difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are \nShopping Cart Conditions\n and \nCart Item Conditions\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nShopping Cart Conditions\n tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nCart Item Conditions\n tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers\u2019 shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don\u2019t see the attribute you want when setting \nGift Card\u2019s Conditions\n, such as SKU, you can go to Catalog\u2192 Attributes\u2192 Manage Attributes. Search and choose Attribute Code, such as \"SKU\". Then change \"Use for Promo Rule Conditions\" to \"Yes\".\n\n\nRemember to click on \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n button to save your work.

Prices  tab:\nIn  Prices  tab, Admin can configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product. \nThe extension provides 3  types of Gift Card value , including  fixed value, range of values and dropdown values . You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the  range of values  type.\nThe next step you need to do is selecting the type of Gift Card price, which could be 1 in 3 following options:   Default : Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.  Fixed number : Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field.  Percent of Gift Card value : Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value as you configure in the next field.\nIf you choose the type of Gift Card price as  Fixed number  or  Percent of Gift Card value ,\nremember to fill in the next field  Price/ Percentage  to set the price for your Gift Card product.\nThe following example will help you have better understanding about these configurations.  Type of Gift Card value : Dropdown values  Gift Card values : 20,30,40  Type of Gift Card price : Percent of Gift Card value  Percentage : 90,90,90\nSo Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.     Conditions  tabs:\nThe difference between a Gift Card product and a normal product is that a Gift Card product contains 2 more condition tabs, which are  Shopping Cart Conditions  and  Cart Item Conditions .    The  Shopping Cart Conditions  tab enables you to set up the conditions applied to shopping cart when Customers use Gift Card, for example: Customers can only use their Gift Card for orders which have Subtotal equals or is greater than $200.      The  Cart Item Conditions  tab allows you to set up Gift Card usage conditions applied to each item in Customers\u2019 shopping cart. For example, Customers can use their Gift Cards to pay for orders only if the Qty. in cart is equal or greater than 2.    Note : Normally some common product attributes are enabled to use with promotion rules by default. If you don\u2019t see the attribute you want when setting  Gift Card\u2019s Conditions , such as SKU, you can go to Catalog\u2192 Attributes\u2192 Manage Attributes.

The question is how to keep Customers returning and buying in your store? We offer you a wonderful solution- that is Magento Reward Points Plus extension. It is designed to maximize Customers engagement in your store by many useful features. \n\n\nWith Reward Points \u2013Standard Edition, your Customers can receive reward points when placing orders on your site. These points then can be converted to money for checkout at the rate configured by you. The System will show messages about the number of points Customers will earn and spend. Customers certainly feel more encouraged to purchase at your site when they can get some bonus for doing that!\n\n\n(image 1)\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\n\n\n2.1.    How to earn points\n\n\nWhen placing an order, Customers can earn points based on the rate set by admin.\nOur Standard edition makes sure that Customers are well aware of your reward point policy by showing messages on many pages. For example, on Product Detail pages, there will be a notification for Customers that says \u201cYou could receive some Points for purchasing this product\u201d.\n\n\n(image 2)\n\n\nAlso, after clicking on the \nAdd to Cart\n button, on \nMini Cart\n, Customers will see another notification \u201c\nCheck out now to earn points\n\u201d.\n\n\n(image 3)\n\n\nIf Customers have not logged in yet, a notification message \u201c\nLogin and checkout to earn points\n\u201d will be shown on mini cart:\n\n\n(image 4)\n\n\nOn \nCheckout\n page, Customers can see exactly the number of points they earned from buying that product in the \nGrand Total\n box:\n\n\n(image 5)\n\n\nIf Customers have not logged in yet, a notification message \u201c\nLogin and checkout to earn points\n\u201d will be shown on \nGrand Total\n box of checkout page:\n\n\n(image 6)\n\n\nAfter placing an order successfully, Customers can check their point balance right next to the \nMy Account\n top link or can go directly to that link: \n\n\n(image 7)\n\n\nHow to spend points\n\n\nOn \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout\n pages, Customers can move the slide forwards or backwards to select the number of points they would like to spend.

Besides, they can enter this number in the empty box or tick the checkbox \u201c\nMaximize my discount with points\n\u201d to spend the maximum number of points. \n\n\n(image 8)\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout\n page, System shows a similar form for Customers to edit the number of points they want to spend for their orders:\n\n\n(image 9)\n\n\nManage reward points\n\n\nCustomers can follow and manage their current points in 2 places:\nOn the one hand, they can view their current points on the top link as below:\n\n\n(image 10)\n\n\nOn the other hand, they can go to \nMy Account > My Rewards\n to view more information.\n\n\n(image 11)\n\n\nAs you can see, this page can be divided into two parts: \nReward Information\n and \nRecent Transactions\n\n\n\n\nReward Information\n: In this part, Customers can view their current balances as well as description about earning/ spending point rates on your site.\n\n\nRecent Transactions\n: This part provides Customers with information on their transactions of reward points including ID, points, action, date and status. \nIf Customers want to see all transactions, they can click on the \nView all\n links or the \nPoint Transactions\n tab. \nBesides, in the \nSettings\n tab of the \nReward Points\n navigation, Customers can set up their \nReward Points Subscriptions\n.\n\n\n\n\n(image 12)\n\n\n3.

With Magento Store Credit extension, you can enhance the interaction with your Customers by many activities such as adding credit or refunding Customers by credit. After that, Customers can use the credit to make purchases on your store or even share with their friends. Also with Magento Store Credit extension, credit can be used as a convenient and time-saving payment method when it just requires your Customers to recharge their credit accounts one time and then use for many future purchases.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nBuy Credit Product\n\n\nAfter Customers login to your website, they can access the \nStore Credit\n page in two ways.\n\n\nFirstly, clicking on the \nMy Account\n link, they can choose \nBuy Store Credit\n in the dropdown list. \n\n\n\nSecondly, they can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation on the \nMy Account\n page.\n\n\nIn this second way, they will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button:\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the \nStore Credit\n page will be shown as follows:\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page lists all credit products of your website. There are three types of credit products for Customers to choose:\n\n\n\n\nFixed Value\n: These credit products have fixed value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption Value:\n With this type, Customers can select a value option in the drop-down list box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Value\n: With this type, Customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, Customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Customer\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by ticking \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient\n\n\nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The\n   system will send an email to this address.\n\n\nCustom message\n: the message that recipient will receive\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, if the recipient do not have an account in the system will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient has an account in the system, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance.\n\n\n\n\nThe sender always gets email notifications as below:\n\n\n\n\nManage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nIn order to access the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nMy Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\nManage Credit Balance\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\n\n\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows Customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n and \ncredit balance.\n\n\n\n\nSend Credit to Friends\n\n\nFirst, Customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page.\n\n\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit To Friends\n and \nCredit Code List\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nSend Credit to Friends\n: In this section, Customers can send credit to their friends.\n\n\n\u2022   \nCredit Code List\n: This section shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed in full for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\nCase 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIn order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the \nSend\n button. \nAfter that, his credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below:\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. When a recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\n\n\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the Cancel link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \nRedeem Credit\n for more information.\n\n\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions of sharing credit in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email has been registered on the website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the recipient\u2019s email address has been registered on your website, our module will send credit directly to his credit balance instead of sending credit code to his email.\nCustomers can check their current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, recipients can get information about this transaction:\n\n\n\n\nCase 2: Customers are required to verify their credit sharing.\n\n\nIf you configure that Customers have to verify before sharing credit, after clicking on the \nSend\n button, they will receive an email as below:\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, they will be navigated to the \nVerify\n page:\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, our module shows them a notification about the verification requirement. In the \nCredit Code List\n, that code is put under the \u201c\nAwaiting verification\n\u201d status with a \nVerify\n link. \n\n\nTo verify, Customers just enter the verification code they received in their emails and then click on the \nSubmit Code\n button.\n\n\nAfter Customers finish verifying, our module will send credit to the recipient.\n\n\nRedeem Credit\n\n\nIn order to go to the \nRedeem Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nRedeem Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can redeem the credit code they received to their credit balance by entering the code in the text field before clicking on the \nRedeem\n button. Another way is just to click on the link in the email.\nAfter redeeming code, Customers can check their current balance and transaction in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout by Credit\n\n\nCustomers can use credit to checkout on both \nShopping Cart\n and \nCheckout page\n.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nShopping Cart\n page, our module will add a \nCustomer Credit\n block for Customers to use their credit balances to checkout.\nTo use a credit amount, Customers can first enter that number in the field and then click on the \nApply\n button. Our module will auto-update and calculate the grand total of order.\nPlease note that Customers cannot use credit to buy credit products. If their carts have one or more credit products, our module will show a notification in the \nCustomer Credit\n block as below:\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nCheckout page\n, in the \nPayment Information\n tab, Customers can also use credit to check out by ticking on the checkbox and then enter a credit amount they want.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Customers click on the \nContinue\n button, our module will auto-update the Grand Total of the order.\nAfter order has been placed, Customers\u2019 credit balances will be updated immediately. They can check the current balances and transactions in the \nTransaction History\n section.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\nManage Customers Using Credit\n\n\nGo to \nStore Credit > Manage Customers Using Credit\n\n\n\n\nThen the \nCustomers Using Credit Manager\n page will be displayed as below:\n\n\n\n\nThis page shows a list of all Customers using credit and their information such as name, email, credit balance, telephone, etc.\nIn order to view more details about a Customer, you can click on the \nEdit\n link in the \nAction\n column.\n\n\nThen you will be navigated to the \nStore Credit\n tab on the \nCustomer Manage\n page that shows you all of that Customer\u2019s transaction history and credit balance:\n\n\n\n\nBesides, you can change the Customer\u2019s credit balance by entering an integer (a positive or negative number) and a comment in text fields as below:\n\n\n\n\nOur module will auto send email to Customer to announce about this transaction if you tick on \nSend email to customer\n checkbox.

If so, no need to look any further as our Magento Store Locator extension is exactly the right solution for you. With various search fields and a friendly user interface, Customers can easily locate the most convenient store, such as the one within 5 kilometers of their homes for instance, and then get instant directions on Google map. In particular, Magento Store Locator extension can help promote your stores effectively by allowing Customers to view and give Facebook comments on the store.\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO USE\n\n\n\n\nThis section shows you how Customers can make use of the Store Locator extension in frontend. The module creates a separate page listing all stores and detailed pages for each store. \nTo go to the \nStore Listing\n page, Customers can click on \nAccount\n \u2192 \nStore Locator\n, then click the \nAccount\n button on the top right corner.\n\n\n\n\nStore Listing Page\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, this page contains 2 main parts: \nSearch\n and \nStore List\n.\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n: In this section, Customers can search for stores either by distance from a specific location or by store location such as country, city, etc. After Customers fill in search criteria and click on the \nSearch\n button, all matching results will be shown. Clicking button \nReset\n will return Customers to the list of all stores.\nFor example, if a Customer wants to search for stores within a 100-mile radius of his location, such as London, United Kingdom, he simply fills corresponding information into the \nSearch by Distance\n fields. With Google Suggest integrated, when the Customer enters some first characters into \nYour Location\n, a list of matching locations is shown in the drop-down so he can conveniently pick a suitable one. \nAfter Customers click on the \nSearch\n button, the results are shown on both G-map and store list as below:\n\n\nCustomers can also get directions to each store by entering a specific location and clicking on the \nGo\n button. The detailed directions are as follows:\n\n\nMoreover, customers can see the real street that the store locates in by clicking on \nStreet View\n link:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStore List\n: This part shows all stores of your site on both list and G-map. Each store is shown with name, address, \nStreet View, Direction\n link and store image, etc. Customers can click on any store they want to know more in details, then they will be redirected to a \nStore Detailed\n page.\nIn addition, store\u2019s information can include a link if you provide it in backend. It can be the official website URL, store Facebook fan page URL, etc. so that Customers can view more information about the store. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Customers click on a store on the list, its location is marked on the map by a colored pin. For example, after a Customer selects the Cameratek Durban store, the extension will show its location on the map as below:\n\n\nThen Customers can zoom in/ out the map to have a clearer view. Information of a store can be displayed on the map as a tooltip. Customers can turn the tooltip off if they want.\n - Another helpful feature is the \nFilter by Tags\n bar at the bottom of the \nStore Listing\n page, which allows Customers to narrow down their choice of stores. When Customers click on any tag as preferred, the extension shows stores tagged with that label. This will certainly save much time for Customers from scrolling up and down on the list, especially when the list of stores is too long.\n\n\n\n\nStore Detailed Page\n\n\nCustomers will be navigated to the \nStore Detailed\n page if they click on the store name they want.\n\n\n\nOn this page, Customers can see store address, opening time, special days, holidays and store images. Besides, Customers not only can view comments about the store but also can give their own comments to discuss with others on Facebook.\nSimilar to the \nStore Listing\n page, Customers can get directions to a store by entering their location and clicking on \nGet Directions\n to see instructions:\n\n\n\n\nHOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\n\n\nYou have seen how Store Locator works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the extension in back-end.\n\n\nNew release\n*: One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was \nthat required future product updates are only available for\n \nrequests made with an API key\n**. \n\n\nThis means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.  \n\n\nIn order to get API key, follow these steps as follows: \n\n\nStep 1\n: Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click \nCreate project\n button on top of the menu. \n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n: Fill in the project name and click Create button\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n: On the menu at the left side, you will see the \nCredentials\n Tab. Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with \n\"API key\"\n on it. It is where you should click in order to create API key for your browser apps.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that you will see a box with a number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create. \nChoose Browser\n key.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n: Fill in your name and domain and then click create\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n: Get the key and paste it in your page\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n: Last but not least, in Library tab, let\u2019s enable the APIs in red frame as below \n\n\n\n\nManage store\n\n\nTo set up stores with location, opening time and other information, go to \nStore Locator \u2192 Manage Stores.\n\n\n\n\nOn this \nStore Manager\n page, you can view a list that shows information of all stores in your site such as n\name, address, city, country, zip code and status.\n\nYou can use the mass action to delete or change status of stores. Besides, you can also export the list of stores to CSV or XML files.\n\n\nAdd store\n\n\nTo add a new store, click on the \nAdd Store\n button. The new \nStore Information\n page includes 3 tabs: \nGeneral Information, Google Map and Time Schedule.\n \n\n\n\n\nGeneral Information\n tab:\nThere are 4 fields in this tab including: \nGeneral Info, Location Info, Contact Info, Meta Info.\n\n\nGeneral Info\n: in this tab you can provide a lot of detailed information about your store to help your Customer locate it easier. \n\n\n\n\n\nBesides important information such as Store name, Description, Status, here are some extra fields you should use to optimize user experience:\n\n\n\u2713 \nStore\u2019s link\n: enter a link to the store\u2019s official website or social channel such as Facebook fan page.\n\n\n\u2713 \nStore's Tag(s)\n: enter any tags related to the store, such as product category, so that Customers can use them to filter stores and narrow down their option.\n\n\n\u2713 \nSort order\n: Sort the display order of store on the store listing page. The store with higher sort order will be shown first. This value will be used as the Default option of \"List Store by\" in Settings.\n\n\n\u2713 \nStore Image(s)\n: upload as many store images as you want. The base image will be shown in the store list. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Info\n: fill your store\u2019s address in this field, remember to click on the \nSave Store\n or \nSave And Continue Edit\n button to save your work. After that, store\u2019s location will be updated automatically on Google Map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Info\n: fill in with the following information about the store in order to allow Customers to contact with store owners or store assistants easier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta Info\n: allows you to optimize search information in each store's detail page. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Map\n tab: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are 4 fields in this tab including \nZoom Level, Store Latitude, Longitude\n and \nStore Icon\n. \n\n\n\u2713 \nZoom Level\n: It is used when previewing the store\u2019s location on Google Map in backend and on the Store Listing page in frontend. The higher number you set, the higher zoom-in level is.\n\n\n\u2713   \nStore Latitude\n and \nStore Longitude\n: You do not need to fill them out if you do not remember your store\u2019s coordinates. After you save, the extension will automatically provide these figures corresponding to the store address you enter in the General Information tab.\n\n\n\u2713   \nStore Icon\n: You can upload an icon to use as store\u2019s marker on G-map instead of the default pin icon. \n\n\n\n\nTimer Schedule\n tab:\n\n\n\n\nThis tab allows you to set opening time for a store. Let us take Monday for example:\n- If your store opens on Monday, choose Yes for Open.\n- If your store opens from 8 am to 10 pm, set Open Time as 8:00 and Close Time as 22:00.\n- The extension also allows you to set break time for each store if you want. \nSimilarly, you can set opening hours for each remaining day of the week. To quickly set up, click on the \nApply to other days\n button on the top right corner of the \nMonday\n section. Other days will have the same working time as Monday.\n\n\n\n\nAfter entering all the necessary data, remember to click on the \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n button to save your work.\n\n\nImport Stores\n\n\nClick on the Import \nStore button\n on the top right corner of the \nStore Manager\n page. You will be navigated to the \nImport File\n page.\n\n\n\n\nCSV file structure\n\nYou can download the sample \u201cstores.csv\u201d file to view its structure. The columns are attribute values of the store and each row corresponds to one store. The title row (first row) contains the attribute name. Please note that you cannot edit it (important!) because the system reads data from CSV files based on the name. If the attribute value of any stores is null, you don\u2019t have to fill data into it.\n\n\nImport file\n\u2713   Create a CSV file with information of your stores following the sample file structure\n\n\n\n\n\u2713   Click on button \nBrowse\n to select your CSV file\n\n\n\u2713   Select \nImport\n to import the CSV file\n\n\n\n\nEdit Store\n\n\nIn order to edit a store, you can click on the \nEdit\n link of any store row on the \nStore Manager\n grid. Besides existing fields as when you add a new store, you should pay attention to the \nGoogle Map\n tab. When a store is imported or created manually, the system will automatically get the coordinates based on the store address by using Google API. However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the \nGoogle Map\n tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.\n\n\n\n\nIf the pin on the map is not in the right place, you can drag and drop it to where you want to set a new location.\n\n\n\n\nAfter editing, remember to click on the \nSave\n or \nSave and Continue Edit\n button to save your work.\nNote: When you edit the store address (street, city or state/province) in \nGeneral Information\n, the store coordinates will be auto-updated after being saved. You also can click the \nRenew Google Map\n button to update the store\u2019s new location.\n\n\nManage Holidays\n\n\nTo set days off for your stores, go to \nStore Locator \u2192 Manage Holidays\n on the menu in backend. You will be navigated to the \nHoliday Manager\n page listing all holidays created. Holidays within a specific period, which is set in \nSettings\n, will be shown in the \nStore Information\n tab on the \nStore Detailed\n page. \nClick on \nAdd Holiday\n to create a new one. \n\n\n\n\nOn the \nAdd Holiday\n page:\n\n\n\n\nSelect store(s) to apply holiday from the list\n\n\nSelect the start date and end date of holiday\n\n\nFill in the \nComment\n field if needed\n\n\n\n\nRemember to click on the \nSave Item\n button after entering required fields to save your work.\n\n\nManage Special Days\n\n\nTo set days with special working time for your stores, go to \nStore Locator \u2192 Manage Special Days\n on the menu in backend. You will be navigated to the \nSpecial Day Manager\n page listing all special days created. Days within a specific period, which is set in \nSettings\n, will be shown in the \nStore Information\n tab on the \nStore Detailed\n page.\nClick on the \nAdd Special Day\n button to create a new one.\n\n\n\n\nOn the \nAdd Special Day\n page:\n\n\n\n\nSelect store(s) to apply special working days from the list\n\n\nSelect the start date and end date of special days\n\n\nChoose open and closing time applied to these special days\n\n\n\n\nRemember to click on the \nSave Item\n button to save your work. \n * \nNote\n: Special days have the highest priority compared with holidays and other days. If a specific date is assigned as both store\u2019s special day and holiday, it will be counted as special working day. The store still opens on that date but with special opening hours as you configured.\n\n\nSetting\n\n\nTo configure the Store Locator extension, go to \nStore Locator \u2192 Settings\n on the menu in backend. The configurations here are divided into 4 groups including \nGeneral, Google, Facebook\n and \nStore Search\n.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nFields\n\n\nSample\n\n\nResult\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEnable\n\n\nYes\n\n\nStore Locator extension is enabled on your site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nList Store by\n\n\nAlphabetical order\n\n\nStore full list and store search result list are sorted by alphabetical order.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance\n\n\nIf Customers search stores by distance, the result list is sorted from the nearest to the furthest ones. \nNote\n*: this configuration is not applied to \nSearch by Area** and the store full list since Customers do not enter a specific location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault\n\n\nStore list is sorted based on Sort Order of each store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nPage Title\n\n\nStore Locator\n\n\nThe title of Store Listing and Store detailed pages in frontend is \u201cLocate Store\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nDisplay holidays and special days in the next\n\n\n30\n\n\nStores\u2019 holidays and special days within the next 30 days will be shown on Store Detailed pages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogles:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo integrate Google API in your site, fill your Google Map API key into this field.

            "text": "As can be seen, this page contains 2 main parts:  Search  and  Store List .   Search : In this section, Customers can search for stores either by distance from a specific location or by store location such as country, city, etc. After Customers fill in search criteria and click on the  Search  button, all matching results will be shown. Clicking button  Reset  will return Customers to the list of all stores.\nFor example, if a Customer wants to search for stores within a 100-mile radius of his location, such as London, United Kingdom, he simply fills corresponding information into the  Search by Distance  fields. With Google Suggest integrated, when the Customer enters some first characters into  Your Location , a list of matching locations is shown in the drop-down so he can conveniently pick a suitable one. \nAfter Customers click on the  Search  button, the results are shown on both G-map and store list as below: \nCustomers can also get directions to each store by entering a specific location and clicking on the  Go  button. The detailed directions are as follows: \nMoreover, customers can see the real street that the store locates in by clicking on  Street View  link:     Store List : This part shows all stores of your site on both list and G-map. Each store is shown with name, address,  Street View, Direction  link and store image, etc. Customers can click on any store they want to know more in details, then they will be redirected to a  Store Detailed  page.\nIn addition, store\u2019s information can include a link if you provide it in backend. It can be the official website URL, store Facebook fan page URL, etc. so that Customers can view more information about the store.     When Customers click on a store on the list, its location is marked on the map by a colored pin. For example, after a Customer selects the Cameratek Durban store, the extension will show its location on the map as below: \nThen Customers can zoom in/ out the map to have a clearer view. Information of a store can be displayed on the map as a tooltip. Customers can turn the tooltip off if they want.\n - Another helpful feature is the  Filter by Tags  bar at the bottom of the  Store Listing  page, which allows Customers to narrow down their choice of stores. When Customers click on any tag as preferred, the extension shows stores tagged with that label. This will certainly save much time for Customers from scrolling up and down on the list, especially when the list of stores is too long.",

New release *: One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was  that required future product updates are only available for   requests made with an API key **.   This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains. However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key in order to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.    In order to get API key, follow these steps as follows:   Step 1 : Visit APIs Console at https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library and log into your Google Account.  Then, click  Create project  button on top of the menu.    Step 2 : Fill in the project name and click Create button   Step 3 : On the menu at the left side, you will see the  Credentials  Tab. Click this tab and after that, a box will appear with  \"API key\"  on it. It is where you should click in order to create API key for your browser apps.   After that you will see a box with a number of choices specifying which kind of key you would like to create.  Choose Browser  key.   Step 4 : Fill in your name and domain and then click create   Step 5 : Get the key and paste it in your page   Step 6 : Last but not least, in Library tab, let\u2019s enable the APIs in red frame as below",

Permitted reproductions, in whole or in part, shall bear this notice.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nBarcode by definition is the small image of lines (bars) and spaces that is affixed to retail store items, identification cards, and postal mail to identify a particular product number, person, or location. The code uses a sequence of vertical bars and spaces to represent numbers and other symbols. Barcode is a reliable method for cutting costs and saving time for business.\n\n\nBarcode management extension from Magestore provides your business with a handful solution to generate barcode, print barcode label and scan barcode, all in one.\n\n\nHow it works\n\n\n1. Barcode Listing\n\n\nBarcode listing is a view to display all barcodes of all products saved in Inventory Management. It contains Barcode, SKU, Supplier and Purchased Time.\n\n\nFrom this screen, admin can easily Import barcode or Generate Barcode with 2 buttons on the top right.\n\n\n\n\nAdmin can also view details of each product and barcode.\n\n\n\n\nFrom barcode detailed page, admin can configure barcode printing and print barcode directly. \n\n\nProduct information is shown including Image, name, price and its availability in each warehouse.\n\n\n2. Generate barcode\n\n\nInventory Management gives you 2 modes to generate barcode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne barcode per product sku\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple barcode per product sku\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be configured in Barcode Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product sku\u201d as \u201cYes\u201d, then the system will allow you to generate one barcode for one product sku only.\n\n\n\n\nNow to generate barcode, you go to Generate Barcodes tab. From here you can select the product that you want to generate barcode, fill in the Supplier (optional) then generate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you set \u201cOne barcode per product sku\u201d as \u201cNo\u201d, then it opens up 2 options to generate barcode when you go to Generate Barcodes tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese 2 options are: Generate barcode per item or Generate barcode per purchase.\n\n\n\u201cGenerate barcode per item\u201d means each item will have its own identified barcode although they have the same SKU.\n\n\n\u201cGenerate barcode per purchase\u201d means items will be identified by the time it is purchased. Although you take 10 items with same SKU in one time purchasing from supplier, these 10 items will have the same barcode. But in another time of purchase, they will have different barcode.\n\n\nAfter selecting the option you want to proceed with, you can continue selecting product, fill the product Qty. , supplier and  purchased time (optional) then generate.\n\n\nAdmin can configure the barcode pattern to generate. Barcodes generated will be saved in Barcode listing page & Barcode created history.\n\n\n\n\n3. Import barcode\n\n\nWhen your products already have a pre-generated barcode, you will not need to use Generate barcode feature. Instead, you can import barcode directly into the system using Import barcode feature of Inventory Management. \nThe system provides a sample import file including SKU, Barcode, Qty. and Supplier & Purchase time (optional).\n\n\n\n\nAfter preparing the file, now you can upload the file, fill the reason and start to Import.\n\n\n4. Barcode template\n\n\nYou can create your own barcode template by adding new template. There are also 3 most used templates as default templates in the extension: A4, jewelry and standard for you to select.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure paper width and height, label width and height, font size\u2026and preview the template before saving.\n\n\n\n\n5. Print barcode\n\n\nIn Barcode configuration, admin can select the barcode template from the templates created before to print. \n\n\n\n\nAdmin can select multiple barcodes to print at once. Or click to View under Details column to print one barcode multiple times.\n\n\n\n\n6. Scan barcode\n\n\nIn Inventory Management extension, you need to use a Barcode scanner which is able to connect with your computer. Then you can scan to read product information or update stock Qty. when doing Stock taking (Stock taking is a feature available in Inventory Management extension).\n\n\n\n\nWhen going to Scan Barcode, you can read barcode information and product information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Stock-taking, there are 5 steps: 1- General information, 2-Prepare product, 3-Stock take, 4-Complete data entry, 5-Complete Stock take. Scanning can be applied at step 2: Prepare product before Stock take. From this step, there is an option to import products and sample files are provided. You can use a barcode scanner to scan product with Qty. into an excel/csv file. Then upload the file with Qty. counted by barcode scanner into the system to update Stock take Qty.

Why not join this trend by creating Gift Card/ Gift Voucher as a 1-size-fits-all gift? With this extension, Customers can purchase Gift Cards to present others and then recipients can use them to buy products at your store. It\u2019s a great idea for helping you increase customer satisfaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.   \nHOW TO USE\n\n\nThis section demonstrates how Customers can use Gift Cards in frontend.  \n\n\n2.1. \nPurchase a Gift Card Product\n\n\n\n\nGift Card can be ordered as a normal product. Customers can enter or choose the value and quantity of Gift Card they want to order, then click on \nAdd to Cart\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of Gift Card product may differ from Gift Card value. It depends on Admin\u201fs configuration in the backend, which could be a fixed value or a percentage of Gift Card value. If the \u201eprice type\u201f is \u201cpercentage\u201d, Customers will see the corresponding Gift Card prices when they choose different Gift Card values.\n\n\nAfter choosing a preferred template, Customers can select 1 out of available background images. It is possible for Customers to personalize their Gift Card by uploading their own image as well. The recommended size for images to upload is 600x365px for the Top layout or 744x455px for the Amazon layout. 3 file types are supported including .GIF, .JPG and .PNG.\nIf Customers upload an image with an unsupported file type or the image is larger than the maximum file size configured by Admin, the system will auto-show an alert message to notify Customers.\nCustomers can also see the expiration date of the Gift Card on Gift Card image.\n\n\nFor Gift Card products that have \nusage conditions\n, the conditions will NOT be displayed below the product name as in Magento 1 version. However, the admin can write the conditions in the description if it is necessary for customers to see. If anyone want to redeem the gift cards (enter the gift code to purchase one or many products) but does not meet the condition(s), then the system will show an 'Invalid' notice.\n\n\nCustomers can also send Gift Cards to their friends by ticking \nSend Gift Card to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n<>\n\n           -\nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient\n  \n\n     - \nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email which contains a Gift Card code to this address.\n   \n\n     - \nCustom message\n: the message is delivered along with the Gift Card code.\n     \n\n     - \nDay to send\n: Customers can set up the date and time zone that a Gift Card will be sent.\n     \n\n     - If Customers want a Gift Card to be sent through a post office, they need to tick \nSend through post office\n checkbox. Gift Card product will be shipped as normal products.\n     \n\n     - If Customers want to get the notification email when their friend receives Gift Card, they need to tick the \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n checkbox.\n     \n\n     - To preview how the Gift Card actually looks like when recipients receive, Customers can click on the Gift Card thumbnail image or the \nPreview Gift Card\n button. A popup of Gift Card interface will be shown as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Customers add a Gift Card to cart, they can go to shopping cart page to review the cart by clicking on the \ncart icon\n on top right corner, then choose \nView and edit cart\n. Customer can edit and update the quantity of the gift card right on the Add to cart popup. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n - The details of Gift Card when Customers send the Gift Card to their friend\n\n\n\n\n\n -  The details of Gift Card when Customers buy the Gift Card for themselves:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Gift Cards products can be checked out as normal products. Customers will receive a Gift Card code if they buy for themselves. In case Customers purchase the Gift Card to send to their friends, the code will be delivered to their friends\u2019 email with the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Sender has ticked the checkbox \nGet notification email when your friend receives Gift Card\n, a notification will be sent to his email address immediately after the Gift Card is delivered to the friend\u2019s email as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers purchase Gift Card for themselves, the notification email that they receive is as below:\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Use Gift Card as a discount method\n\n\nWhen Customers have Gift Card codes, they can use them as a discount coupon when ordering a product at the Checkout page:\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can choose to use Gift Cards and enter the amount of money as on\n\nShopping Cart\n page. Then click on \nAdd Gift Card\n button to apply.\n\n\n*Note\n: Gift Card codes cannot be used to purchase Gift Card products but they can be spent on shipping fee, depending on Admin\u201fs settings.\n\n\n3.   HOW TO CONFIGURE\n\n\n*Important Note\n: If you use a different theme from the default theme of Magento, you need to move template, skin and layout files into your theme folder: \n-  app/design/frontend/base/default/....\n- skin/frontend/base/default/css/magestore/...\n\n\n3.1.

Stock listing\n\n\nWarehouse\n\n\nAfter installation, the system will automatically provide a \nPrimary Warehouse\n. This warehouse cannot be deleted and can only be edited. All the existing products with stocks level of your website will be automatically allocated in this warehouse first before being sent to other warehouses.\n\n\nA warehouse contains basic information including Total SKU, total Qty, contact email, telephone, street, city, country and status\n\n\nAdmin can add new warehouse then fill all information including warehouse name, contact, country\u2026\n\n\n<\n>\n\n\nManage user/staff & Permission\n\n\nPermission in Inventory extension allows admin to create multiple users and user roles.

Now admin can view a list of role and create a new role for users. Role information contains role info (name & password) and role resource. This role resource contains every part of Inventory that this role can be able to access to. For example if you set this role as Manager, you can grant some important permission to Delete warehouse, confirm Physical stock taking or complete a Stock request\u2026by selecting the check boxes then Save Role.\n\n\n<\n>\n\n\n\n\nAssign staff to warehouse\n\n\n\n\nGo to Warehouses under Stock Listing submenu then select any warehouse, there is a configuration for Permission.

Permitted reproductions, in whole or in part, shall bear this notice.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nDo you know that the average abandonment rate is over 66%? Many Customers abandon online shopping on the checkout page due to complicated process. Improve it now by using One Step Checkout extension! All Checkout information such as billing address, shipping and payment method will appear together for Customers to fill in/ correct information of any step any time.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use\n\n\nThis section will show you how Customers engage on the Checkout page when your website uses One Step Checkout extension. You will see many improvements that make it much faster and easier for Customers to complete placing order.\n\n\nOne Step Checkout page Overview\n\n\nIf you set enabling \nRedirect to checkout automatically after adding product to cart\n (see more in \nsession 3.1\n), whenever Customers choose product and click Add to cart, it will be automatically navigated to Checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nOtherwise, Customers have to select the cart icon in the top-right corner and click on \nGo to Checkout\n. Then, it will redirect to the Checkout page. Here they can see the difference between the Step-by-Step default Checkout page of Magento and One Step Checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nThe Step-by-Step checkout page is a page with 5 separate steps including \nBilling Address, Shipping Address, Shipping Method, Payment Method\n and \nOrder Review\n. Customers have to complete each step before going to the next one. On the One Step Checkout page, all steps appear simultaneously. \nCustomers can fill in/edit information of any steps any time.\n This improvement can save Customers 2-3 minutes for checkout.\n\n\nOrder Comment\n\n\nCustomers also can add additional comments to their orders on the Checkout page, such as special instructions or the color of wrapping paper.\n\n\n\n\nSign up for Newsletter\n\n\nYou can ask Customers to sign up for your newsletter during checkout by just enabling the checkbox \nSign Up for Our Newsletter\n. You can even set it checked by default. This method is an easy way to help you gain many more subscribers to maintain relationship later.\n\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\nTo avoid any arising dispute after Customers place order, make sure they fully understood and agreed to your Terms and Conditions. You\u2019d better require Customers to check the box \u201cI read and agree to Terms and Conditions\u201d. When Customers click on the \nTerms and Conditions\n link, a popup with detailed information will show.\n\n\n\n\nAfter filling in required information, Customers click on the Place order now button to finish. They will see a confirmation page like this.\n\n\n\n\nLogin/Sign up if required\n\n\nStore-owners may want to require Customers to log in or sign up before placing an order. If Customers already have an account, they can click on \nClick here to login or create a new account\n. A popup will be displayed. They just need to enter their email address and password then click on the \nLogin\n button.\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers forget their password, they can click on \nForgotten your password?\n Then enter their email address and click on the \nSend password\n button. The module will send a new password to their email address.\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers don\u2019t have an account in your site, they can create one right away by clicking \nCreate a new account\n, filling in the required information, then click \nRegister\n. The new account will be created before placing orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is super convenient, right? Signup and Checkout at the same time help you manage Customers and Orders more easily without swaying conversion rate.\n\n\nBilling Address, Shipping Address\n\n\nIf Customers have already logged in, they can skip the \nShipping Address\n section as their information is automatically added. If Customers want to change shipping address, select \nNew Address\n and change the information.\n\n\n\n\nIn case of not logging in, they will see fields to fill in: First name, Last name, Address...as you configured in backend.\nAfter providing a shipping address, if Customers want to create bill to another address, they can unselect the box \nMy billing and shipping address are the same\n then fill information in the \nBilling Address\n section.\n\n\n\n\nIn both \nBilling Address\n and \nShipping Address\n sections, when Customers type some first characters of their address, the system will show matching results suggested by Google.\n\n\n\n\nCustomers just need to select a correct option and then, other fields such as \nCity, Country, Zip Code, State/Province\n will be automatically filled out.\n\n\n\n\nWhen there is any change in \nShipping Address\n and \nBilling Address\n sections, \nShipping Method, Payment Method\n and \nOrder Review\n will be updated right away without reloading the page. Why is this feature useful? Let us give an example. A Customer may consider between 2 shipping addresses. He can see right on the checkout page that for 1 address, shipping fee is cheaper and payment method can be Cash On Delivery, but with the other address, just money transfer and advanced payment are accepted.\n\n\n\n\nShipping Method, Payment Method\n\n\nAfter Customers choose or change \nShipping Method\n and \nPayment Method\n as preferred, the \nOrder Review\n section will be updated correspondingly.\n\n\n\n\nTime of Delivery\n\n\nTo bring the most convenience to your Customers, you can enable the \nDelivery time and date\n in backend. Then at checkout they can select when will be most suitable for them to receive items ordered.\n\n\n\n\nOrder Review\n\n\nThe \nOrder Review\n section shows all items ordering as well as product images. If Customers change their decision, they can edit quantity or remove products without going back to the Shopping Cart page. Any changes will be updated right at checkout.\n\n\n\n\nCoupon Code\n\n\nWith the default checkout of Magento, Customers only can apply coupon codes on the \nShopping Cart\n page. With One Step Checkout extension of Magestore, you can let Customers enter their coupon code right below \nOrder Review\n on the checkout page.\n\n\n\n\nAfter Customers apply coupon code, the \nEstimated Total\n will be updated as below:\n\n\n\n\nIf Customers do not want to use that coupon code anymore, they can click on the \nCancel\n button.\n\n\nGift Message\n\n\nMagestore\u2019s One Step Checkout supports gift purchasing effectively. Customers can add a gift message along with their order. They just need to enter the sender name, recipient and message into text fields.\n\n\n\n\nGift Wrap\n\n\nYou can provide gift-wrap service at checkout and configure its price. After Customers tick option \nGift Wrap\n, a gift-wrap fee will be added, and \nEstimated Total\n will be updated.\n\n\n\n\nHow to configure\n\n\nYou have viewed the features which Magestore One Step Checkout provides in frontend. This part will tell you how to enable all those features in backend.\nGo to \nOne Step Checkout > Settings\n.\nYou will be navigated to the \nOne Step Checkout Configuration\n page where you can set up, configure our module to get it to work as you wish.\n\n\nGeneral Configuration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nField\n\n\nIf you choose...\n\n\nResult will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nEnable One Step Checkout\n\n\nYes\n\n\nOne Step Checkout feature becomes active on the checkout page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nEnable billing to different address\n\n\nYes\n\n\nEnable the checkbox named \u201cMy billing and shipping address are the same\u201d.

There are 8 colors for you to select, including orange, green, black, blue, dark blue, pink, red and violet. If none of the default colors match your desire, you can select the Custom option and then customize your preferred one using the color picker table. With each store, you can select the color you want or use the default color.\nAfter selecting a color, you will see a preview of your checkout page with the color chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can choose a default color for the \nPlace Order Now\n button or customize it.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you complete all settings, remember to click \nSave Config\n.

Sometimes, just viewing is not enough to really understand and enjoy something. It could be greater if you have an ownership of it and make it work as you wish. So, why don\u2019t you take action right away to feel its amazing effects on your sales?\n\n\nField Position Management\n\n\nThis section lets you enable/disable and rearrange the positions of fields in \nBilling/Shipping Address\n sections.\nNote: \nFirst Name, Last Name\n and \nEmail Address\n are required in Magento 2 system. If you disable these fields, Customers cannot place order even if they fill in all information.\nYou can rearrange fields into 2 columns like \nFirst Name\n on the left and \nLast Name\n on the right and spare \nAddress\n a full column by choosing \nAddress\n + \nNull\n.\n\n\n\n\nBesides, this section allows you to configure multiple stores so that the position of fields displayed on the One Step Checkout page will change according to each store\u2019s settings.\nFor example, if you want Default and Second store to be shown differently, choose \nMain Store > Default/Second Store\n in the \nCurrent Configuration Scope\n box in the top-left corner. Then, rearrange the position as you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you configure in backend, the Checkout page will be shown in frontend as below:\n* Default store:\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond store:\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired Field Management\n\n\nThis tab allows you to configure which fields must be filled in to complete an order. Choose \nYes\n for required fields and \nNo\n for optional fields. As in the \nField Position Management\n tab, three fields, including \nFirst Name, Last Name\n and \nEmail Address\n, are required by default.\n\n\nAuto-update Sections\n\n\nIn this tab, you can configure which sections will be automatically updated whenever Customers change their information.\n\n*Note:\n The Checkout page is loaded fast or slowly depending on these configurations. To maximize your website\u2019s loading speed, you should enable only triggering fields and updated sections that are necessary and disable the unneeded ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo\n\n\nField\n\n\nIf you choose...\n\n\nResult will be\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections updated when changing in Address\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAuto update Sections following changes in Address\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update sections \nShipping Method, Payment Method\n and/ or \nOrder Review\n when Customers change information in \nBilling/Shipping Address\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nAddress fields triggered updating Sections\n\n\nCountry, Postcode, State/region, City\n\n\nAuto-update chosen sections when Customers change information in the \nCountry, Postcode, State/region, City\n fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nReload Sections\n\n\nWhen all required fields are field\n\n\nReload chosen sections when Customers change information in all required fields above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nUpdate Shipping Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nShipping Method\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nUpdate Payment Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nPayment Method\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in triggering fields.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections updated when changing in Shipping Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nUpdate Payment Method\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nPayment Method\n section when Customers change information in \nShipping Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in \nShipping Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSections update when changing in Payment Method\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nUpdate Order Review\n\n\nYes\n\n\nAuto-update the \nOrder Review\n section when Customers change information in \nPayment Method\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Terms and Conditions\n: Choose whether to show the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup on the One Step Checkout page or not.\n\n\nTerms and Conditions Title\n: Set a title for the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup.\n\n\nTerms and Conditions Content (HTML)\n: Enter your \nTerms and Conditions\n by using HTML code.\n\n\nEnable custom size\n: Choose whether to customize size of the \nTerms and Conditions\n popup or not.\n\n\nWidth\n: Set the width of the popup\n\n\nHeight\n: Set the height of the popup\n\n\n\n\nAdmin Order Notification\n\n\nAn important feature of One Step Checkout is to send email notifications to Admin when new orders are placed.

Magento Store Credit extension for Magento 2 allows you to enhance the interaction with your Customers by many activities such as adding credit or refunding Customers by credit. \nCustomers can use the credit to make purchases on your store or even share with their friends. \nWith Magento Store Credit extension for Magento 2, credit can be used as a convenient and time-saving payment method. Customers just need to recharge their credit accounts one time and then use for many future purchases.\n\n\n\n\n2. HOW TO USE (Frontend)\n\n\nThis section will show you how Customers can make use of \nStore Credit extension for Magento 2\n in Frontend.\n\n\n2.1. Buy Credit Product\n\n\nAfter Customers login to your website, they can access the Store Credit Products page in two ways:\n\n\n\u2022   \nOption 1\n: on the top navigation bar, click to \nBuy Store Credit\n \n\n\n\u2022   \nOption 2\n: click on the \nStore Credit\n on the left navigation of the \nAccount Dashboard\n page\n\n\nIn this second way, they will be navigated to the \nMy Credit\n page on which they just need to click on the \nBuy store credit\n button\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, the \nStore Credit\n page will be shown as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this page lists all \nCredit Products\n of your website. There are three types of credit products for Customers to choose:\n\n\n\u2022   \nFixed Value\n: These credit products have fixed value. \n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nDrop-down Values\n: With this type, Customers can select a specific value in the drop-down list.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nRange of Values\n: With this type, Customers can choose a desired credit amount within the range configured by admin in backend. \n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting credit products they like, Customers can add them to cart and checkout normally.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the order is complete, our module will auto-add that credit amount to the Customer\u2019s credit balance.\nCustomers can also send Credits to their friends by ticking \nSend credit to friend\n checkbox and enter all the required fields:\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nRecipient name\n: the name of the recipient \n\n\n\u2022   \nRecipient email address\n: the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email to this address\n\n\n\u2022   \nCustom message\n: the message that recipient will receive\n\n\nWhen the order is completed, there will be two cases happening based on signup status of the recipient email address.\n\n\n\u2022   \nCase 1\n: if the recipient do not have an account in the system, an email as below will be sent \n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nCase 2\n: if the recipient has already had an account in the system, the system will automatically add that credit amount to the Recipient\u2019s credit balance\n\n\n\n\nIn both cases, the sender always gets email notifications as below:\n\n\n\n\n2.2. Manage Credit on My Credit page\n\n\nIn order to access the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can click on the \nStore Credit\n tab on the left navigation.\n\n\n2.2.1. Manage Credit Balance\n\n\nOn the \nMy Credit\n page, Customers can view information about their current credit balances and transaction history.\nIn the section \nTransaction History\n, our module shows Customers all of their credit transactions with a lot of information including \ndate, type, details, added/deducted value in transaction\n and \ncredit balance\n.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2. Send Credit to Friends\n\n\nFirst, Customers should click on the \nSend Credit\n tab on the left navigation to go to the \nSend Credit to Friends\n page.\nThis page has 2 parts including \nSend Credit to Friends\n and \nCredit Code List\n.\n\n\n\n\n\u2022   \nSend Credit to Friends\n: allows Customers to send credit to their friends by filling in all required information\n\n\n\u2022   \nCredit Code List\n: shows all information about the credit codes that Customers sent to their friends including \ncode, recipient\u2019s email, amount, sent date\n and \nstatus of code\n. Credit codes are not displayed fully for security purpose. When Customers click on, they will be shown clearly.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that our module allows you to configure whether to require your Customers to verify their credit sharing or not. We will consider the two cases separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na.  Case 1: Customers are not required to verify their credit sharing\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to send credit to friends, Customers should enter the recipient\u2019s email and credit amount in the text fields. Our module will check that email address and show notification to Customers.\n\n\n\u2022   \nIf the recipient\u2019s email has not been registered on the website\n: \n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our module will show a notification for the Customer that his friend will receive the credit code via that email. The Customer can enter a message and click on the \nSend\n button. After that, the sender\u2019s credit balance will be deducted immediately and an email will be auto-sent to the recipient\u2019s email address.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, this email informs the recipient about the credit amount, message and a credit code which can be used to redeem credit to his balance.\nAt the same time, the sender can also see the sent credit code in the \nCredit Code List\n section as below:\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Customers can follow the status of the credit codes they sent. While the recipient has not redeemed a credit code, Customers are allowed to cancel it by clicking on the \nCancel\n link in the \nAction\n column. After the cancellation, the recipient cannot redeem that credit code any more.\nOtherwise, once the credit code has been redeemed, the status will be updated and the \nCancel\n link will be disabled. Please refer to the section \n2.2.3.
