## HOW TO USE

There are two stages in an inventory adjustment process: **Stocktaking and Stock Adjustment**. Stock-taking or "inventory checking" is the physical verification of the quantities and condition of items held in an inventory or warehouse. This may be done to provide an audit of existing stock. It is also the source of stock discrepancy information. 

To begin, inventory excutive staff will count every items in the inventory location, then check the physical count against the system records. If there are any discrepancies, inventory excutive staff have to make a note about variances and follow up where necessary. Once the stock take has been finalized, update the inventory records in the module inventory adjustment.
