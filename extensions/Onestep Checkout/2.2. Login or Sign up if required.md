### Login/Sign up if required

Store-owners may want to require Customers to log in or sign up before placing an order. If Customers already have an account, they can click on **Click here to login or create a new account**. A popup will be displayed. They just need to enter their email address and password then click on the **Login** button.

If Customers forget their password, they can click on **Forgotten your password?** Then enter their email address and click on the **Send password** button. The module will send a new password to their email address.
