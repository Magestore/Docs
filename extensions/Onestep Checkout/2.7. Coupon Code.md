### Coupon Code

With the default checkout of Magento, Customers only can apply coupon codes on the **Shopping Cart** page. With One Step Checkout extension of Magestore, you can let Customers enter their coupon code right below **Order Review** on the checkout page.

After Customers apply coupon code, the **Estimated Total** will be updated as below:
