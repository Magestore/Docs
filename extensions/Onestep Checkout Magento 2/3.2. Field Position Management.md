### Field Position Management
This section lets you enable/disable and rearrange the positions of fields in **Billing/Shipping Address** sections.
Note: ***First Name, Last Name*** and ***Email Address*** are required in Magento 2 system. If you disable these fields, Customers cannot place order even if they fill in all information.
You can rearrange fields into 2 columns like **First Name** on the left and **Last Name** on the right and spare **Address** a full column by choosing *Address* + *Null*.

Besides, this section allows you to configure multiple stores so that the position of fields displayed on the One Step Checkout page will change according to each storeâ€™s settings.
For example, if you want Default and Second store to be shown differently, choose **Main Store > Default/Second Store** in the **Current Configuration Scope** box in the top-left corner. Then, rearrange the position as you want.
