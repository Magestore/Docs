### Terms and Conditions
To avoid any arising dispute after Customers place order, make sure they fully understood and agreed to your Terms and Conditions. You’d better require Customers to check the box “I read and agree to Terms and Conditions”. When Customers click on the **Terms and Conditions** link, a popup with detailed information will show.
