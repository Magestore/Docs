## 1.	**INTRODUCTION**
More and more Customers go online to find gifts for their friends and families, instead of wandering from shop to shop to buy the best gift. Why not join this trend by creating Gift Card/ Gift Voucher as a 1-size-fits-all gift? With this extension, Customers can purchase Gift Cards to present others and then recipients can use them to buy products at your store. It’s a great idea for helping you increase customer satisfaction.

## 2.	**HOW TO USE**
This section demonstrates how Customers can use Gift Cards in frontend.  
### 2.1. **Purchase a Gift Card Product**
- Gift Card can be ordered as a normal product. Customers can enter or choose the value and quantity of Gift Card they want to order, then click on **Add to Cart** button.

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image006.jpg)

- The price of Gift Card product may differ from Gift Card value. It depends on Admin‟s configuration in the backend, which could be a fixed value or a percentage of Gift Card value. If the „price type‟ is “percentage”, Customers will see the corresponding Gift Card prices when they choose different Gift Card values.
- After choosing a preferred template, Customers can select 1 out of available background images. It is possible for Customers to personalize their Gift Card by uploading their own image as well. The recommended size for images to upload is 600x365px for the Top layout or 744x455px for the Amazon layout. 3 file types are supported including .GIF, .JPG and .PNG.
If Customers upload an image with an unsupported file type or the image is larger than the maximum file size configured by Admin, the system will auto-show an alert message to notify Customers.
Customers can also see the expiration date of the Gift Card on Gift Card image.
- For Gift Card products that have **usage conditions**, the conditions will NOT be displayed below the product name as in Magento 1 version. However, the admin can write the conditions in the description if it is necessary for customers to see. If anyone want to redeem the gift cards (enter the gift code to purchase one or many products) but does not meet the condition(s), then the system will show an 'Invalid' notice.
-  	Customers can also send Gift Cards to their friends by ticking **Send Gift Card to friend** checkbox and enter all the required fields: 

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image008.jpg)

   <><br/>
           -**Recipient name**: the name of the recipient
  <br/>
     - **Recipient email address**: the email address of the recipient. The system will send an email which contains a Gift Card code to this address.
   <br/>
     - **Custom message**: the message is delivered along with the Gift Card code.
     <br/>
     - **Day to send**: Customers can set up the date and time zone that a Gift Card will be sent.
     <br/>
     - If Customers want a Gift Card to be sent through a post office, they need to tick **Send through post office** checkbox. Gift Card product will be shipped as normal products.
     <br/>
     - If Customers want to get the notification email when their friend receives Gift Card, they need to tick the **Get notification email when your friend receives Gift Card** checkbox.
     <br/>
     - To preview how the Gift Card actually looks like when recipients receive, Customers can click on the Gift Card thumbnail image or the **Preview Gift Card** button. A popup of Gift Card interface will be shown as below:

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image010.jpg)
     
- 	After Customers add a Gift Card to cart, they can go to shopping cart page to review the cart by clicking on the **cart icon** on top right corner, then choose **View and edit cart**. Customer can edit and update the quantity of the gift card right on the Add to cart popup.

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image018.jpg)

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image020.jpg)

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image024.jpg)

**Shopping Cart** page. Then click on **Add Gift Card** button to apply.

***Note**: Gift Card codes cannot be used to purchase Gift Card products but they can be spent on shipping fee, depending on Admin‟s settings.

Go to **Gift Card** menu→ **Manage Gift Card Products**

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image054.jpg)

You should pay attention to the following tabs:
<br/>

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image056.jpg)
Different from normal products, there is another required field, **Select Gift Card template**, allowing you to choose templates for **Gift Card product**. You can add more templates to this field in Manage Gift Card Templates (please refer to section **3.1** for more details).

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image058.jpg)

After filling in general information, you should pay attention to Advanced Settings to configure Price & Conditions for Gift Card Products
<br/>
        -  **Avanced Pricing** tab:
In **Avanced Pricing** tab, Admin can configure prices and values of a Gift Card Product. 

![GC2](https://github.com/Magestore/Docs/blob/master/extensions/Magento%202%20Extensions/GC2%20Image/image060.jpg)

The extension provides 3 **types of Gift Card value**, including **fixed value, range of values** and **dropdown values**. You can base on the type chosen to set Gift Card value(s) accordingly such as 50-100 (USD) for the **range of values type**


The next step you need to do is selecting the type of **Gift Card price**, which could be 1 in 3 following options:
<br/>
    + **Default**: Gift Card price is the same as Gift Card value by default.
<br/>
    + **Fixed number**: Gift Card price is a fixed number as you configure in the next field
<br/>
    + **Percent of Gift Card value**: Gift Card price is a percentage of Gift Card value asyou configure in the next field.
    
If you choose the type of Gift Card price as **Fixed number** or **Percent of Gift Card value**, remember to fill in the next field **Price/ Percentage** to set the price for your Gift Card product.

The following example will help you have better understanding about these
configurations.
<br/>
    + **Type of Gift Card value**: Dropdown values
<br/>
    +**Gift Card values**: 20,30,40
<br/>
    +**Type of Gift Card price**: Percent of Gift Card value
<br/>
    +**Percentage**: 90,90,90

So Customers only have to pay 90% of Gift Card value, which means $36 for a $40 Gift Card for instance.
