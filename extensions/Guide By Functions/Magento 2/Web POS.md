**Gerneral Information** 
(1)	POS Name: POS’s name.

**Close Sessions** 
![Guide%20By%20Functions/Magento%202](.Web%20POS%20Image/4.png)
This section will display the statistics of Closed Sessions after staff working days. When you create a brand-new POS, this section is empty, and it will be updated automatically after being used in reality. 

This might be demonstrated like this:

You can use more than 1 payment method for split payments when checkout with Web POS. Let me give you an example.
**Customer’s order value is $153**
-	Your customer wants to pay $100 in Cash on Delivery. Then, you fill in the blank space **Web POS – Cash On Delivery** with the value of $100.

![WebPOS](./Web%20POS%20Image/image052.png)

-	For the remaining ($53), your customer wants to pay by cash. So, at this time, you click on the **Add Payment** button and choose **Web POS – Cash In**. The remaining amount ($53) will be automatically filled in Cash In box. 

![WebPOS](./Web%20POS%20Image/image053.png)

**Notes**:<br/>
    -	Support multiple payment methods for one order<br/>
    -	Not require Cash in method as compulsory

**Process part of order payment and keep orders on hold**
With Web POS, you can also apply split payment when keeping orders on hold to process part of order for your customers. For example, your customer wants to reserve the good before it will be launched. His order value is $195. He pays $100 as reservation.<br/>
-  When processing payment, choose **Web POS – Cash In** with the value of $100 and the rest with COD (or other payment methods as you wish).<br/>
-  After finishing creating order, in the next step, don’t create invoice or shipment for this order. To do this, you need to turn off **Mark as shipped** and **Mark as paid** as in the following screenshot.

![WebPOS](./Web%20POS%20Image/image054.png)

Click **Back** button to return to items selecting and press Hold to keep orders on hold. For more information about On-hold Orders, please go to section **How to keep orders on hold for further processing**.

![WebPOS](./Web%20POS%20Image/image055.png)

-	After the customer is ready to complete the whole order payment, go to **On-hold** orders and choose that order to continue processing. However please note that this kind of order will not be recorded in backend and order value will not be counted in report.

### How to keep orders on hold for further processing
Your customers can't make up their minds yet, or are unable to make a payment meanwhile? They may want to purchase items that are for pre-order or currently out of stocks? You don't want to lose those potential customers, don't you? Then, Web POS's new feature can put these orders on hold - no limit in time - until they are ready to continue processing!
After adding products to cart, you can choose **Hold** to put the order into **On-hold Orders** section. 
To check orders that have been put on hold, select **On-hold Orders** section. List of on- hold orders is recorded. You may select **Continue Processing** whenever customer is willing to take final action for payment or you may **Cancel** it if it is not effective anymore.
