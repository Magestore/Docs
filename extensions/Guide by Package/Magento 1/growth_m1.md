This section will display the statistics of Closed Sessions after staff working days. When you create a brand-new POS, this section is empty, and it will be updated automatically after being used in reality. 

**Current Session Detail** 

The same situation happens with Current Session Detail for the brand-new POS. No data is saved, and it will display like this:
