### Store Pick up 

You have seen how Store Pickup works in front-end for customers. The following part will guide you through how to configure and manage the module in back-end.

_Tips_: For quick instructions on where to set up each function and how to get Google Map API Key, you can go to: **Store Pickup > Settings > General**

Click on the link for Google Map API Key Registration Guide

![Sample](./Image_Growth_m1/image066.png?raw=true)

_Update_: **One of the most important Google Maps APIs Standard Plan updates implemented on June 22, 2016 was that** required future product updates are only available for requests made with an API key.

This means active domains created before June 22, 2016, continue to be able to access the Google Maps JavaScript API, Static Maps API, and Street View Image API without an API key. They are not affected by keyless access being unavailable for new domains.

However, Google Maps APIs Standard Plan advises all developers to use a key to guarantee their quality of service. Applications that continue to make keyless requests may experience some periodic service degradation if other keyless applications' usage spikes and draws down the global unchanged quota.

Click on the Import Store button on the top right corner of the **Store Manager** page. You will be navigated to the **Import File** page.

**CSV file structure**

You can download the sample _**stores.csv**_ file to view its structure. The columns are attribute values of the store and each row corresponds to one store. The title row (first row) contains the attribute name; you can note it (important!) because the system reads data from CSV files based on the name. If the attribute value of any stores is null, you don’t have to fill data in to it.

![Sample](./Image_Growth_m1/image077.png?raw=true)

This tab shows you all pickup orders of this store.

_Notes_:

When a store is imported or created manually, the system will automatically get the coordinates based on the store address by using Google API. However, in some cases, this way may be not completely accurate. Therefore, the Google Map tab allows you to edit store coordinates manually.

You can see it at the left upper. Click on this tab, the Google map will be displayed. You can reset store position by clicking on any point on the map, and then select **Save Store**.

When you edit the store address (street, city or state/province) in **General Information**, the store coordinates will be auto-updated after being saved. You can also edit the color of store’s pin shown on map and preview it.
